	@page TOPPView_introduction Introduction

	  TOPPView is a viewer for MS and HPLC-MS data. It can be used to inspect files in mzML, mzData, mzXML
	  and several other text-based file formats.

	 	In each view, several datasets can be displayed using the layer concept. This allows visual comparison
	 	of several datasets as well as displaying input data and output data of an algorithm together.

		TOPPView is intended for visual inspection of the data by experimentalists as well as for
		analysis software by developers.

		@image html TOPPView_parts.png
		@image latex TOPPView_parts.png "" width=14cm

		The above example image shows a 2D view of TOPPView (blue rectangle) and the corresponding
		@ref TOPPView_modes (red rectangle). In the right dock area, you can see the @ref TOPPView_layers
		(yellow rectangle), the @ref TOPPView_browser (magenta rectangle)
    and the @ref TOPPView_filtering tool (green rectangle). Switching between open windows
		can be done using the tab bar (black rectangle).

	@section TOPPView_layers Layers

		Each view of TOPPView supports several datasets, called layers. In the @a layer @a manager
		(dock window in the upper right corner), layers can be hidden and shown using the check box in front of each layer name.

		By clicking on a layer, this layer is selected, which is indicated by a blue background.
		The selected layer can be manipulated using the @a Tools menu.

		Layers can be copied by dragging them to the tab bar. If the layer is dropped on a tab, it is added
		to the corresponding window. If the layer is dropped on the tab bar but not on a tab, a new window
		with that layer is added.

  @section TOPPView_browser Spectrum browser

		The spectra contained in a peak map can be browsed in the @a spectrum @a browser. It displays
		a tree view of all spectra in the current layer, where a spectrum with MS level @a n is a child
		of the spectrum with MS level @a n - @a 1 that contains its corresponding precursor peak.
		For each spectrum in the list, the retention time and (for spectra with MS level > 1) the m/z value of
		the precursor peak are also shown.

		If a 2D or 3D window is active, double-clicking a spectrum will open it in a new 1D window. If
		the active window is a 1D view, the spectra can be browsed and the currently selected spectrum will
    be shown.

	@section TOPPView_filtering Data filtering

		TOPPView allows filtering of the displayed peak data and feature data.
		Peak data can be filtered according to intensity and meta data. Meta data
		is arbitrary data the peak is annotated with.
		Feature data can be filtered according to intensity, charge, quality and
		meta data.

		Data filters are managed by a dock window.
		Filters can be added, removed and edited through the context menu (right button mouse click)
		of the data filters window. For convenience, filters can also be
		edited by double-clicking them.

	@section TOPPView_command_line Command line options

    Several files can be opened in one layer from the command line by putting a
    '+' character between the file names. The following command opens three
    files in three layers of the same window:
    @code TOPPView file1.mzML + file2.mzML + file3.mzML@endcode
    Without the '+' the files would be opened in three different windows.

    The color gradient used to display a file can be changed by adding one of
    several '@' commands. The following command opens the file with a white-to-black
    gradient:
    @code TOPPView file1.mzML @bw@endcode

    For more information on command line parameters call:
    @code TOPPView --help@endcode

	@section TOPPView_help Looking for help?

		You can display a short help text for each button and dock window of TOPPView by
		clicking on it in @a What's @a this? mode. @a What's @a this? mode can be entered
		using the @a Help menu.

/**
	@page TOPPView_views The views

		TOPPView offers three types of views -- a 1D view for spectra, a 2D view for peak maps and
		feature maps, and a 3D view for peak maps. All three views can be freely configured to suit
		the individual needs of the user.

	@section TOPPView_views_use Basic use

		All three views share a similar interface. Three action modes are supported -- one for translation,
		one for zooming and one for measuring:
		- Translate mode
		  - It is activated by default
		  - Move the mouse while holding the mouse button down to translate the current view
		  - Arrow keys can be used to translate the view without entering translate mode (in 1D-View you can additionally use Shift-key to jump to the next peak)
		- Zoom mode
		  - All previous zoom levels are stored in a zoom history. The zoom history can be traversed using CTRL+/CTRL-
		    or the mouse wheel (scroll up and down)
      - Zooming into the data:
		    - either mark an area in the current view with your mouse, while holding the left mouse button plus the @em CTRL key to zoom to this area.
        - or use your mouse wheel to traverse the zoom history
        - if you have reached the end of the history and keep on pressing CTRL+ or scroll up, the current area will be enlarged by a factor of 1.25
		  - Pressing the @em Backspace key resets the zoom and zoom history
    - Measure mode
      - It is activated using the @em SHIFT key
      - Press the left mouse button down while a peak is selected and drag the mouse to another peak to measure the distance
        between peaks
      - This mode is implemented in the 1D and 2D mode only

	@section TOPPView_views_1d 1D view

		The 1D view is used to display raw spectra or peak spectra.
		Raw data is displayed using a continuous line. Peak data is displayed using one stick per peak.
		The color used for drawing the lines can be set for each layer individually. The 1D view offers
		a mirror mode, where the window is vertically divided in halves and individual layers can
		be displayed either above or below the "mirror" axis in order to facilitate quick visual comparison
		of spectra. When a mirror view is active, it is possible to perform a spectrum alignment of a
		spectrum in the upper and one in the lower half, respectively. Moreover, spectra can be annotated
		manually. Currently, distance annotations between peaks, peak annotations and simple text
		labels are provided.

		The following example image shows a 1D view in mirror mode. A theoretical spectrum (lower half) has been
		generated using the theoretical spectrum generator (@a Tools > @a Generate @a theoretical @a spectrum ).
		The
		mirror mode has been activated by right-clicking the layer containing the theoretical spectrum and
		selecting @a Flip @a downward from the layer context menu. A spectrum alignment between the two
		spectra has been performed (@a Tools > @a Align @a spectra ). It is visualized by the red lines connecting
		aligned peaks and can be reset through the context menu. Moreover, in the example, several
		distances between abundant peaks have been measured and subsequently replaced by their corresponding
		amino acid residue code. This is done by right-clicking a distance annotation and selecting @a Edit
    from the context menu. Additionally, peak annotations and text labels have been added by
		right-clicking peaks and
		selecting @a Add @a peak @a annotation or by right-clicking anywhere and
		selecting @a Add @a label, respectively.
		Multiple annotations can be selected by holding down the CTRL key while
		clicking them. They can be moved around by dragging the mouse and deleted by pressing DEL.

		Through the <B>context menu:</B> of the 1D view you can:
		<UL>
			<LI> View/edit meta data
			<LI> Save the current layer data
			<LI> Change display settings
			<LI> Add peak annotations or arbitrary text labels
			<LI> Reset a performed alignment
		</UL>

	@section TOPPView_views_2d 2D view

		The 2D view is used to display peak maps and feature maps in a top-down view with color-coded
		intensities. Peaks and feature centroids are displayed as dots. For features, also
		the overall convex hull and the convex hulls of individual mass traces can be displayed.
		The color gradient used to encode for peak and feature intensities can be set for
		each layer individually.

		The following example image shows a small section of a peak map and the detected features
		in a second layer.

		@image html Spectrum2DWidget.png
		@image latex Spectrum2DWidget.png "" width=8cm

		In addition to the normal top-down view, the 2D view can display the projections
		of the data to the m/z and RT axis. This feature is mainly used to assess the quality
		of a feature without opening the data region in 3D view.

		Through the <B>context menu:</B> of the 2D view you can:
		<UL>
			<LI> View/edit meta data
			<LI> View survey/fragment scans in 1D view
			<LI> View survey/fragment scans meta data
			<LI> View the currently selected area in 3D view
			<LI> Save the current layer data
			<LI> Change display settings
		</UL>


	@section TOPPView_views_3d 3D view

		The 3D view can display peak maps only. Its primary use is the closer inspection of a small
		region of the map, e.g. a single feature. In the 3D view slight intensity differences are
		easier to recognize than in the 2D view.
		The color gradient used to encode peak intensities, the width of the lines and the coloring
		mode of the peaks can be set for each layer individually.

		The following example image shows a small region of a peak map:

		@image html Spectrum3DWidget.png
		@image latex Spectrum3DWidget.png "" width=8cm

		Through the <B>context menu:</B> of the 3D view you can:
		<UL>
			<LI> View/edit meta data
			<LI> Save the current layer data
			<LI> Change display settings
		</UL>

/**
	@page TOPPView_analysis Data analysis

		TOPPView also offers limited data analysis capabilities for single layers, which will
		be illustrated in the following sections. The functionality presented here
		can be found in the @a Tools menu:

		@image html TOPPView_tools_menu.png
		@image latex TOPPView_tools_menu.png "" width=6cm

	@section TOPPView_tools TOPP tools

		Single TOPP tools can be applied to the data of the currently selected layer or to
		the visible data of the current layer.
		The following example image shows the TOPP tool dialog:

		@image html TOPPView_tools.png
		@image latex TOPPView_tools.png "" width=8cm

		To apply a TOPP tool, do the following:
		- Select a TOPP tool and if necessary a type.
		- Specify the command line option of the tool, that takes the input file name.
		- Specify the command line option of the tool, that takes the output file name.
		- Set the algorithm parameters manually or load them from an INI file.

	@section TOPPView_metadata Metadata

		One can access the meta data the layer is annotated with.
		This data comprises e.g. contact person, instrument description and sample description.

		@image html MetaDataBrowser.png
		@image latex MetaDataBrowser.png "" width=12cm

		@note Identification data, e.g. from a Mascot run, can be annotated to the spectra or features,
		too. After annotation, this data is listed in the meta data as well.

	@section TOPPView_statistics Statistics

		Statistics about peak/feature intensities and peak meta information can be displayed.
		For intensities, it is possible to display an additional histogram view.
