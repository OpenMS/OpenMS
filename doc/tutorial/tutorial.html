		<H2>Kernel</H2>
			The <tt>KERNEL</tt> folder contains classes that represent the actual MS data: 
			Peaks, Spectra, Features, Maps, ...
			<img src="Kernel.png">

			<H3>Traits</H3>
				The traits class used as template argument of many Kernel classes determines the type
				that e.g. position, intensity and charge have. By default most of these types are doubles.
				<BR>
				If you do not need double precicion, you can use float traits instead.

			<H3>D-dimensional coordinates</H3>
				<B>DPosition</B> represents a coordinate in D-dimensional space. Dimensions are accessed by <tt>operator[]</tt>.
				<BR>
				<B>DimenstionDescription</b> is used in order to have a defined order of dimensions, if there is more than one dimension.
				The following example demonstrates its use for a LC-MS experiment:
<PRE>
// typedef to avoid too long name
typedef DimensionDescription < DimensionDescriptionTagLCMS > DimDesc;

// create coordiante
DPosition<2> coordiante;

// sets RT and MZ dimentsion
coordiante[DimDesc::MZ] = 500.0;
coordiante[DimDesc::RT] = 0.1;
</PRE>
				<B>DRange</B> is a pair of <tt>DPositions</tt> that spans a D-dimensions hypercube and offers some convenient methods
				e.g. for intersection and center.	
				
			<H3>Raw data, peaks and features</H3>
				<B>DRawDataPoint</B> is rawdata point with a D-dimensional position and an intensity. Raw data means that no 'peak picking'
				or other pre-processing methods were performed on this data.
				<BR>
				<B>DPeak</B> and its derived classes are used for data that on which some kind of 'peak picking' was applied (It also adds
				a interface for persistent storage e.g. in a DB). Although <tt>DPeak</tt> is a 'picked' peak, it does not contain any
				information about the 'peak picking'.
				<BR>
				<B>DPickedPeak</B> is used if more information from any pre-processing steps e.g. width or full width at half max, is available.
				<BR>
				<B>DFeature</B> is also derived from <tt>DRange</tt> but represents a collection of peaks.
				In general, it summarizes all peaks related to a specific peptide or some other chemical entity. 

			<H3>Spectra</H3>
				<B>DSpectrum</B> represents a D-dimensional spectrum i.e. a container of D-dimensional data points (any class derived from
				DRawDataPoint).
				<BR>One of the template arguments of <tt>DSpectrum</tt> is the Container the data is stored in. As container
				<tt>DPeakArrayNonPolymorphic</tt>, <tt>DPeakArray</tt> or <tt>DPeakList</tt> are used.
				<BR>
				<B>DPeakArrayNonPolymorphic</B> is vector of data points with a more convenient interface for sorting of the data.
				<BR>
				<i>DPeakArrayNonPolymorphic is the recommended container, if you do not need polymorphism</i>!
				<BR>
				<B>DPeakArray</B> behaves like <tt>DPeakArrayNonPolymorphic</tt> but is polymorphic, i.e. it can hold peaks of 
				<tt>PeakType</tt> and of classes derived from <tt>PeakType</tt> at a time.
				<BR>
				<B>DPeakList</B> behaves like <tt>std::list<PeakType></tt> but is polymorphic.
				<BR>
				<BR>
				The following example demonstrates the use of a 2-dimensional spectrum of raw data with <tt>DPeakArrayNonPolymorphic</tt> as
				container:
<PRE>
// typedef to avoid too long names
typedef DimensionDescription < DimensionDescriptionTagLCMS > DimDesc;
typedef DSpectrum<2, DPeakArrayNonPolymorphic<2, DRawDataPoint<2> > > Spectrum2D;

// create a spectrum
Spectrum2D spectrum;

// creata a data point
DRawDataPoint<2> data;
data.getPosition()[DimDesc::MZ] = 500.0;
data.getPosition()[DimDesc::RT] = 0.1;
data.getIntensity() = 47.11;

// insert the data point into the spectrum
spectrum.getContainer().push_back(data);

// iterate over the data points
for (Spectrum2D::Iterator it = spectrum.getContainer().begin(); it!=spectrum.getContainer().end(); ++it)
{
  cout << *it << endl;
}
</PRE>

			<H3>Main datastructures</H3>
			<B>MSSpectrum</B> represents a 1-dimensional spectrum of an arbitrary peak type that holds meta information as well (SpectrumSettings).
			<BR>
			<B>MSExperiment</B> represents some two dimensional MS experiment. It is implemented as a vector of MSSpectrum and is derived from ExperimentalSettings for
			meta information.
				
		<H2>Datastructures</H2>
		
			The <tt>DATASTRUCTURES</tt> folder contains shared datastructure classes, e.g. 
			a convenient string implementation.
		
		<H2>Format</H2>
			The <tt>FORMAT</tt> folder contains classes for both database and file I/O.
			<H3>File adapter</H3>

				<B>DTAFile</B> is an adapter to read and write DTA files (*.dta). 
				DTA is a simple ASCII-based format for MS data.
				The first line contains the singly protonated peptide mass (MH+) and the peptide charge state. 	Subsequent lines contain the fragment ion m/z and intensity values.
				<BR>
				<BR>
				All of the following file adapters share a common interface and can read and write (except for <tt>ANDIFile</tt>) to different	datastructures that implement at least the interface of <tt>MSExperiment</tt> with peak type
				<tt>DRawDataPoint</tt>.
				<BR>
				<BR>
				<B>DTA2DFile</B> is an adapter to read and write DTA2D files (*.dta2d),
				an extension of DTA to hold LCMS data. Each line contains the fragment 
				ion retension time, m/z and intensity values.
				<BR>
				<B>MzXMLFile</B> is an adapter to read and write mzXML files (*.mzXML). Based on XML the format contains MS metadata, e.g. instrument settings and sample description, as well as LCMS and MSMS spectra in base 64 format. For more information see 
				<a href="http://tools.proteomecenter.org/mzXMLschema.php">Seattle Proteome Center</a>.
				<BR>
				<B>MzDataFile</B> is an adapter to read and write mzData files (*.mzData).  
				Based on XML the format contains MS metadata (conform with PSI-OM)
				as well as LCMS and MSMS spectra in base 64 format. For more information see
				<a href="http://psidev.sourceforge.net/ms/">HUPO PSI-MS</a>.<BR>
				MzDataFile is able to read and write the additional information of picked peaks 	(<tt>DPickedPeak</tt>) as well.
				<BR>
				<B>ANDIFile</B> is an adapter to read ANDI/MS files (*.cdf). The binary ANDI/MS format is an 
				<B>an</B>alytical <B>d</B>ata <B>i</B>nterchange standard for 
				<B>m</B>ass <B>s</B>pectrometry based on netCDF.
				<BR>
				<BR>
				The following example demonstrates the use of <tt>MzDataFile</tt> and
				<tt>ANDIFile</tt> to convert one format into another using 
				<tt>MsExperiment</tt> to hold the data temporarily. The code can be used interchangeable
				with any other file adapter:

<PRE>
// create the file adapters
ANDIFile andi;
MzDataFile mzdata;

// temporary data storage
MSExperiment< DRawDataPoint<1> > map;

// convert ANDI/MS to MzData
andi.load(map,"dummy.cdf");
mzdata.store(map,"dummy.mzData");
</PRE>


		<H2>Metadata</H2>
		
			The <tt>METADATA</tt> folder contains classes for storage of MS metadata, e.g. 
			instrument settings and sample description. 
			<BR><BR>
			<b>ExperimentalSettings</b> holds metainformation about the experiment the data was created with e.g. the MS
			instrument, the HPLC settings and the operator.
			<BR><BR>
			<b>SpectrumSettings</b> contains metainformation about
			settings specific to one spectrum, i.e. settings of the MS instrument, precorsor
			information (if it is a MS² spectrum) and results of ID engines (Mascot, Sequest, 
			...).
			<img src="MetaData.png">

			<H3>MetaInfo</H3>
				<img src="MetaInfo.png" align=left>
				MetaInfo is used to easily store information of any type you like, that does not fit into the the other
				classes. It implements Name-Value-Type triplets.
				<BR>
				<b>DataValue</b> is a data structure that can store any numerical or string information. It also supports
				casting of the stored value back to its original type.
				<BR>
				<b>MetaInfo</b> is a associative container that stores <tt>DataValues</tt> as values associated to string keys.
				Internally a the string keys are converted to integer keys for performance resaons 
				i.e. a <tt>map&lt;UnsignedInt, DataValue&gt;</tt> is used.
				<BR>
				The <b>MetaInfoRegistry</b> associates the string keys used in <tt>MetaValue</tt> with
				the integer values that are used for internal storage. Each key used has to be registered at the registry first.
				The <tt>MetaInfoRegistry</tt> is a singleton.
				<BR>
				<BR>
				Classes that have one MetaInfo object, inherit from <b>MetaInfoInterface</b>.
				<BR clear="all"> 

		<H2>Transformations</H2>
		
			The TRANSFORMATIONS folder contains classes for the transformations of raw and 
			peak data. 
		
			<H3>RAW2PEAK</H3>
			In this folder transformations from raw to peak data, the so-called "peak picking", 
			can be found.
			
			<BR><BR><B>DPeakPickerCWT</B><BR>
			  This is the main class which you need for peak picking.<BR>
			  Using the following code fragment, peak picking on 2 dimensional raw data is performed:
<PRE>
typedef DPeakArrayNonPolymorphic< 2, DRawDataPoint<2> > RawData2D;

RawData2D raw_data; 

// instantiate a peak picker object
DPeakPickerCWT<2> p(xml_file);

//pick the peaks
raw_data >> p(peaks); 
</PRE>

				The constructor of the peak picker needs either the peak picking parameter 
				stored in a xml file or in a Param object (when the Param object or the 
				file are empty the default peak picking paramter are used). Some 
				sample xml files can be found in OpenMS/source/TRANSFORMATIONS/RAW2PEAK.<br>
				To perform the peak picking on a well defined range of the raw data, the 
				method pick can be directly used:
<PRE>
typedef DPeakArrayNonPolymorphic< D,DRawDataPoint<D> > RawData; 
typedef typename RawData::const_iterator RawConstIterator;

pick(RawConstIterator first, RawConstIterator last, std::back_insert_iterator< PeakShape >& output); 
</PRE>		

				<B>Note:</B>
				<UL>
					<LI> Prefer ContinuousWaveletTransformNumIntegration for peak picking!
					<LI> The Optimization of the peak parameter turned out to be particularly useful for poorly resolved data with strongly overlapping, convoluted peak patterns!
			  </UL>
			
			<BR><BR><B>ContinuousWaveletTransform</B><BR>
				The DPeakPickerCWT uses the continiuous wavelet transformation (CWT) of the raw data to detect potential peaks.
			
			<BR><BR><B>ContinuousWaveletTransformNumIntegration</B><BR>
				This class computes the convolution happens in the CWT by numerical integration.
			
			<BR><BR><B>ContinuousWaveletTransformFFT</B><BR>
				This class computes the convolution happens in the CWT by fourier transformation (only efficient convoluting two signals of approximately the same length).
			
			<BR><BR><B>DExtractSignalRegions</B><BR>
				This class improves the run time of the peak picker by decomposing the raw mass spectra into smaller parts with a typical length of 10 Da..
			
			<BR><BR><B>DSignalToNoiseEstimator</B><BR>
				This class provides the estimation of the signal to noise ratios in a given raw data points intervall
			
			<BR><BR><B>DSignalToNoiseEstimatorWindowing</B><BR>
				This class computes the signal to noise ratio using the method of 
				Roegnvaldsson et al. described in "Modular, Scriptable, and Automated Analysis 
				Tools for High-Throughput Peptide Mass Fingerprinting".
			
			<BR><BR><B>OptimizePick</B><BR>
				  This class implements the optional peak parameter optimization. In the previous 
					stage, each of the peaks has been fitted independently of the others, but for a 
					true separation, we need to fit the sum of all peaks to the experimental 
					signal. OptimizePeak offers a standard technique from nonlinear 
					optimization, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.
					
			<H3>Feature Finder</H3>
			The FeatureFinder implements an algorithms for the identification of features in LC/MS maps. By feature,
			we understand a chemical compound, usually a peptide, contained in the sample. Our algorithm is based
			on an approach that was published in <i>Groepl et al. (2005) Proc. CompLife-05 </i>. Essentially, we
			identify data points with a high intensity (<i>seeding</i>), collect a region of data points around each
			seed (<i>extension</i>) and fit a two-dimensional model to each region (<i>model fitting</i>). 
			This model consists of gaussian mixture representing the m/z dimension and a bigaussian distribution 
			that is fitted in rt dimension. If the quality of this fit is sufficiently high, we declare this region
			as feature, estimate its charge and coordinates and continue with the next seed.<br>
			The FeatureFinder application consists of four different modules: a <b>traits</b> class, <b>seeder</b>,
			<b>extender</b> and <b>model fitter</b>. The traits class reads the data from a file, estimates the
			background noise level and provides access to intensity and coordinates of each data point to the
			individual modules. These modules implements the three steps in the feature finding algoririthm,
			as described above. Each module has several parameters. For a short description of each module
			and its parameters, please have a look at the corresponding header file in the directory
			<tt>/include/TRANSFORMATIONS/FEATUREFINDER/</tt>. In most cases, the standard settings should work
			fine.<br>
			There are two possibilities to use the feature finding algorithms. The first and easiest one is
			to use the corresponding TOPP (TOPP = The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline) module located in
			<tt>source/APPLICATIONS/TOPP/</tt>. It is a commandline program that offers an online help and
			is pretty self-explanatory.<br>
			The second possibility, for the more advanced user who might even want to implement his or her
			own modules, is to use OpenMS as a library and write an FeatureFinder application of your own.
			This is straightforward to do. A short example is given below:
			<PRE>
			DTA2DFile dta2d_file;
			MSExperiment exp;
	
			dta2d_file.load("path_to_rawdata_file",exp);
			  
			FeatureFinder ff;
			ff.setData(exp);
			DfeatureMap<2> features;
			features = ff.run();			
			</PRE>
			This small program loads a data set from a dta2d file, loads this data into the FeatureFinder class
			and runs the algorithm. The resulting features are stored in an instance of class DFeatureMap which
			is a simple container for features. The feature map can be stored or used for further processing.<br>
			The design of the FeatureFinder is in fact a bit more complex that outlined here. For details please
			have a look at the class diagram given below.

		<H2>Filtering</H2>
		
			The FILTERING folder contains classes for calibration, smoothing and the 
			baseline-filtering of raw data.

			<H3>Baseline filtering</H3>
				This is folder contains classes for baseline filtering of raw data.
				
				<BR>
				<BR>
				<B>DTopHatFilter</B>
				<BR>
				This class implements a morphological baseline filter.
				Using the following code fragment, the baseline of 2 dimensional raw data is subtracted:
<PRE>
typedef DPeakArrayNonPolymorphic<2, DRawDataPoint<2> > RawData2D; 

RawData2D raw_data, top_hat_filtered; 

// instantiate a top hat filter object
DTopHatFilter&lt;2&gt top_hat; //use the default constructor with a default value for the length of the structuring element

//remove the baseline and and write the filtered signal into the variable top_hat_filtered 
raw >> top_hat(top_hat_filtered); 
</PRE>
				The parameter in the constructor defines the length of the structuring element (given by the number of its data points).
				<BR><B>Note: </B>
				The structuring element defines the baseline, so choose its length much bigger than the number of data points of a common 
				overlapping isotopic peak pattern (e.g. 21)!

			<H3>Smoothing</H3>
				This folder contains smoothing filter classes for raw data.
				<BR>
				<BR>
				<B>DGaussianFilter</B>
				<BR>
				This class represents a Gaussian lowpass-filter.<BR>
				Using the following code fragment, 2 dimensional raw data are smoothed:
<PRE>
typedef DPeakArrayNonPolymorphic&lt; 2,DRawDataPoint&lt;2&gt; &gt; RawData2D; 

RawData2D raw_data, gaussian_filtered; 

// instantiate a savitzky golay filter object 
DGaussianFilter&lt;2&gt gaussian; //use the default constructor with default values for sigma and the frame length

//remove the noise and write the filtered signal into the variable gaussian_filtered
raw >> gaussian(gaussian_filtered);
</PRE>
				The parameters in the constructor define the length of the filter (given by the number of its data 
				points) and the standard deviation of the gaussian. 
				<BR><B>Note: </B>
				The gaussian filter is normalized, so the area under a peak is preserved, but the maximum position gets 
				blurred. 

<BR><BR><B>DSavitzkyGolayQRFilter and DSavitzkyGolaySVDFilter</B><BR>
This classes represent SavitzkyGolay lowpass-filter.

<PRE>
typedef DPeakArrayNonPolymorphic&lt; 2,DRawDataPoint&lt;2&gt; &gt; RawData2D; 

RawData2D raw_data, sgolay_filtered; 

// instantiate a savitzky golay filter object 
DSavitzkyGolaySVDFilter&lt;2&gt; sgolay; //use the default constructor with default values for the order of the polynomial and the frame length

//remove the noise and write the filtered signal into the variable sgolay_filtered
raw >> sgolay(sgolay_filtered);
</PRE>
				The parameters in the constructor define the 
				length of the filter (given by the number of its data points) and 
				the order of the polynom which is used.
				<BR><B>Note:</B>
				<UL>
					<LI>By decreasing the order of the polynoms or increasing 
							the number of data points, the filtered signal gets smoother (the order x 
							should be 2 &lt;= x &lt;= 4) !
					<LI>The Savitzky Golay filter preserves the maximum position of a peak much 
					    better than the Gaussian filter!
					<LI>The DSavitzkyGolayQRFilter and the DSavitzkyGolaySVDFilter generate 
							the same filtering, but they vary in run time. Try which one is more 
							suitable for your application!
				</UL>
		
		<H2>Visual</H2>
		
			The <tt>VISUAL</tt> folder contains classes of the GUI.
			
			<H3>Preferences Manager</H3>
				<img src="PreferencesManager.png" align=left>
				<b>General Description</b><BR>
				GUI classes that store preferences and create a preferences dialog for them, 
				are derived from PreferencesManager (abbreviated PM for the rest of the text). 
				The preferences have to be stored in the private member PM::prefs_, an object 
				of type Param (see FORMAT/Param.h). PM classes are arranged in a tree 
				structure, where one PM (the parent) can have several clients. Clients are 
				added to a parent along with a name, which is used later on in the 
				visualization of the preferences dialog. See getParent(), setParent(parent), 
				addClient(client, name), removeClient(client) and setClientName(client, name). 
				When the showPreferencesDialog() method of any object in the tree is called, 
				the root object creates a PreferencesDialog and shows it. On the left of the 
				dialog a tree view that corresponds to the object tree is shown and on the 
				right the preferences of the selected entry of the tree view are shown (see 
				figure). All preferences pages on the right side are objects of classes derived 
				from PreferencesDialogPage (abbreviated PDP). <i>Note:</i><BR>
				Preferences that are used very often or are time-consuming to construct from 
				prefs_ can be stored in a second member for faster access. But they should 
				nevertheless be stored in prefs_, as prefs_ is used to persistently store the 
				current state of TOPPView.
				<BR>
				<BR>
				<b>Using the default mechanism for adding new Widgets</b><BR>
				In order to store Preferences of a GUI class and a create preferences dialog 
				for them, derive your class from PM. If you want to use the default preferences 
				mechanism, just add the object as client to a parent. Now your object will have 
				its own dialog page in the preferences dialog. However this page is still 
				empty! Next, you have to derive a class from PDP in order to fill your object's 
				preferences page with life (This new class may be a private class of your PM 
				object, which is defined in the same header/source). In the constructor of the 
				new PDP class you create all the widgets you want to show on the preferences 
				page. In oder to see the new PDP in the preferences dialog, you have to 
				reimplement the createPreferences(parent) method of you PM class. By default 
				this method creates a PDP object and returns a pointer to it. Now you have to 
				create and return a pointer to a object of your class derived from PDP. Now you 
				can see the preferences page but it does not interact with your object at 
				all... The PDP object has a pointer to its creator(or manager) which is an 
				argument to its constructor. Through this pointer, the load() method reads the 
				current settings from the manager and save() writes the preferences back to the 
				manager. Finally, you have to reimplement the load() and save() methods of the 
				PDP. Important: This mechanism works only when there are public set/get methods 
				for all preferences, but they should be there anyway.
				<BR>
				<BR>
				<b>Parents managing clients themselves</b><BR>
				In cases where you do not want a client to be shown as a child in the tree 
				structure, you can just integrate the client's preferences page into the 
				preferences page of the parent. To do that you have to modify the instructions 
				above in the following manner:
				<UL>
					<LI>
					Set the the parent property of the client, but do not add the client as child 
					to the parent = &gt; The preference page is not shown in the dialog anymore.
					<LI>
					Integrate the child PDP into the client PDP by calling createPreferences(…) of 
					the child in the createPreferences(…) method of the client.
					<LI>
						Call the load()/save() method of the client in the load()/save() method of the 
						parent</LI>
				</UL>

		<H2>Analysis</H2>
		This folder contains algorithms and modules for the high-level processing and analysis of LC/MS data.
		
		<H3>Map Matching</H3>
		After a raw data map has been picked and searched for features, we need to map features from different
		maps i.e. experiments onto each other before we are able to make meaningful comparisons. That means
		that we want to identify groups of features that stem from the same peptide in different experiments.
		In OpenMS, this procedure consists of three steps: <b>feature matching</b>, <b>map mapping</b> and
		<b>map dewarping</b>.
		
		<BR><BR><B>Feature Matching</B><BR>
		In this step, we try to identify pairs of features in different maps. So far, two different approaches
		have been implemented. The first and simpler one is a clustering-like approach and tries to cluster features
		to pairs based. The distance is a function of retention time, m/z and intensity of the features. The second
		approach is based on <i>Geometric Hashing</i>. It will usually work better than the simple approach 
		if there is a significant shift in rt and/or m/z between different experiments.
			
		<BR><BR><B>Map Mapping</B><BR>
		The map mapping step tries to estimate a mapping function that maps the coordinates of the feature partners
		that have been identified in the last step on each other. Currently we estimate a piecewise linear function
		using linear regression but it is easy to extend our method to more sophisticated approaches.
		
		<BR><BR><B>Map Dewarping</B><BR>
		The last step in this workflow is called dewarping. It merely consists of the application of the mapping
		function that was estimated in the last step to the feature coordinates. After the dewarping, features that
		have been identified as partners should now have very similar if not identical coordinates. This allows
		an easy comparison of corresponding features in different maps.
		<BR><BR>
		The directory <tt>source/EXAMPLES</tt> contains an example program which shows how to use the diferent classes
		and modules in the map mapping workflow. The class diagram below gives an overview of these classes.
