  @section install_mac_read Introduction

  This document addresses %OpenMS users and explains the installation procedure for building %OpenMS from its sources. 
  If you only want to use the %OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline (TOPP), you are strongly
	encouraged to <b>download the binary installer</b> (see <a href="http://www.OpenMS.de" target="_blank">here</a>),
	instead of building %OpenMS from sources. Be aware though that we do not provide binary installers for every MacOS version.
  For more information read the install instructions for the TOPP binaries.

	This document especially considers the installation of several libraries which are required by %OpenMS. 
  Most of these libraries are made available in our "contrib-package" (see below).
  <br>
  If you encounter errors during configuring/compiling our software, have a look at our "Known Issues" section (documentation),
  maybe the error is already known. If not, please write to the mailing list or report the error on our <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/open-ms/" target="_new">issue tracker</a>.

  @subsection hint_package_manager Package Mangers
  
  We suggest to use either <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/" target="_new">Homebrew</a> or <a href="http://www.macports.org" target="_new">MacPorts</a> as they contain most of the following requirements for %OpenMS and ease the process of upgrading those dependencies.

  @subsection required_apps Required applications

  In order to compile %OpenMS, several applications need to be installed:
  <ul>
   <li>Xcode (version 4.0 or higher) is required to build %OpenMS (the current version can be obtained from the Mac App Store). More details can be found on the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/" target="_new" title="Xcode 4 Downloads and Resources.">Apple Developer Site</a>.</li>
   @note Since Xcode 4.3 you also need to install the "Command Line Tools" to access the compilers shipped with Xcode from the command line. An explanation on how to install the Command Line Tools can be found <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/Articles/xcode_4_3.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/1006-SW1" target="_new" title="Install Command Line Tools for Xcode">here</a>.
   <li>CMake (version 2.8.1 or higher) is required to configure and build the %OpenMS as well as some of its dependencies.</li>
	 <li>Qt4 (version 4.5. or higher) containing qmake and the header files is required (either a dmg file or source packages can be obtained from <a href="http://qt-project.org" target="_new" title="Get Qt">http://qt-project.org/</a>) 
   @note Qt 5 is not yet supported by %OpenMS.</li>
  </ul>
  
  If your %OpenMS version is a development version from SVN, the following
  applications are needed in order to create the %OpenMS documentation:
  
  <ul>  
   <li><a href="http://www.doxygen.org/index.html">Doxygen</a> is used to generate the %OpenMS documentation.</li>
   @note
   We recommend using at least doxygen 1.7.1 (or above) since some 1.6.X versions have a serious bug that makes building the %OpenMS documentation impossible.
   <li>pdflatex is required to generate the tutorial pdfs. The latest MacTeX release can be downloaded <a href="http://tug.org/mactex/">here</a></li>
  </ul>

 @section install_mac_contrib Installing the contrib package

  In order to facilitate the installation of the libraries required for %OpenMS, we composed a
  "contrib-package" containing the libraries Boost, GSL, libSVM, SeqAn, glpk, zlib, bzip2 and Xerces-C.

  The contrib package is contained in the %OpenMS release package and is available inside the <tt>contrib</tt> directory in the %OpenMS directory.

  If you are using the developer version of %OpenMS, you have to check out the contrib from Sourceforge SVN repository

@code
svn co "https://open-ms.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/open-ms/contrib"
@endcode

  CMake is used to check your system and build the contrib libraries.

  @note
  As of %OpenMS 1.10 compiling %OpenMS with the Apple GCC 4.2 compiler can lead to errors due to the update of BOOST to version 1.52. Please use the shipped clang compiler instead (clang/clang++) to avoid this problem.

  <OL>
    <LI>Open a Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app)</LI>
    <LI>Create a build directory for the %OpenMS contrib e.g.,

@code    
$ mkdir ~/openms-development/contrib_build
@endcode
    </LI>
    <LI>Enter the created directory and call cmake to build the contrib

@code
$ cd <path_to_contrib_build>
$ cmake -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang <path_to_contrib>
@endcode

Example:

@code
cd ~/openms-development/contrib_build
cmake -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang ~/openms-development/contrib
@endcode
    </LI>
  </OL>

  If everything worked, the following sub-directories were created under in the contrib build directory:

  <ul>
    <li><tt>lib/</tt> containing the libraries needed by %OpenMS.</li>
    <li><tt>include/</tt> containing the header files needed for %OpenMS.</li>
  </ul>

  @note To avoid problems while building the libraries contained in the contrib package, the path to your contrib directory should not contain any spaces.

<HR>

  @section install_mac_openms Installing OpenMS

  Assuming you have successfully installed the dependent libraries, you need to get the %OpenMS source code. 
  The latest stable version of %OpenMS can be found in the <a href="http://www.openms.de/downloads/" target="_blank">download</a> page. 
  For further (e.g. latest developer version from SVN) info see the <a href="http://open-ms.sourceforge.net/download.php" target="_blank">download instructions</a>.

    <OL>
      <LI>Open a Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app)</LI>
      <LI>Create a build directory for %OpenMS, e.g.,

@code
$ mkdir ~/openms-development/openms_build
@endcode
      </li>
      <LI>Call cmake to create the build system there
      
@code
cd <path_to_OpenMS_build>
cmake -D CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH=<path_to_contrib_build> <path_to_OpenMS>
@endcode

  You can set CMake variables using the <code>-D VARIABLE=VALUE</code> option.
  A full list of the CMake variables is shown when you execute

@code
ccmake ~/openms-development/openms_build
@endcode

  @note You need to execute <code>cmake</code> at least once before <tt>ccmake</tt> can be used.
</OL>

  The most important CMake variables are:

  <table style="border-style:solid; border-collapse:collapse; border-color:#c0c0c0;">
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><tt>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</tt></td>
      <td>Additional search path for the contrib libraries.
          If not set the the location is assumed to be <tt>&lt;path_to_OpenMS&gt;/contrib</tt>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><tt>QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE</tt></td>
      <td>Defines the Qt 'qmake' application to identify the corresponding Qt installation.
      This variable only needs to be set if <tt>qmake</tt> is not in the PATH.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><tt>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</tt></td>
      <td>Should be either 'Release' (optimization enabled) or 'Debug' (debug info and
          precondition/postcondiction checks enabled).
          @n The default is <tt>Release</tt>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><tt>QT_DB_PLUGIN</tt></td>
      <td>Defines the Qt database type. By default MySQL is used.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><tt>CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER</tt></td>
      <td>Defines the C++ compiler to use.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><tt>CMAKE_C_COMPILER</tt></td>
      <td>Defines the C compiler to use. This should match the C++ compiler. Mixing compilers (e.g., <tt>clang++</tt> for C++ and <tt>gcc</tt> for C)
       can lead to undefined behavior as some internal settings (e.g., %OpenMP support) are determined using the C compiler and are assumed to be the 
       same for the C++ compiler.</td>
    </tr>    
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><tt>SEARCH_ENGINES_DIRECTORY</tt> (optional)</td>
      <td>The location where the ID search engines are located. This directory should have the same structure as the one in the %OpenMS svn repository. 
      This directory is needed to build the installer for %OpenMS.</td>
    </tr>        
  </table>

  After CMake was executed, you can list the make targets by calling:

@code
make targets
@endcode

  In order to build the %OpenMS library and TOPP tools execute the following command:
@code
make
@endcode

The TOPP tools should now be ready to use. The executables are located in the <tt>bin/</tt> folder of the build directory. 
Add this folder to your <b><tt>PATH</tt></b> variable for easy access.

 @section install_mac_testing_openms Testing your OpenMS / TOPP installation

  After you have installed %OpenMS and TOPP, you should test your installation by executing the following command:

@code
make test_build
make test
@endcode

  @note To enable DB connectivity tests, use the following CMake parameters:
  <ul>
    <li>DB_TEST</li>
    <li>DB_TEST_HOST</li>
    <li>DB_TEST_PORT</li>
