  @page install_linux_bin Installation on GNU/Linux

  @section deb_package_linux Install Debian package
  If you are using a Debian-based Linux we suggest to use the deb-package provided by us in our <a href="https://abibuilder.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/archive/openms/OpenMSInstaller/release/latest">archive</a>.

  @section package_managers_linux Install via package managers
  Currently there are packaged versions of %OpenMS provided for Fedora, OpenSUSE, Debian, and Ubuntu <a href="https://pkgs.org/search/openms">available in the corresponding package managers</a> of these distributions (they might require a lookup in thirdparty "science" repositories).
  For other GNU/Linux distributions or to obtain the most recent version of the library you need to build your own %OpenMS.
  
  To ensure the tool functionality please add the OPENMS_DATA_PATH variable. 
  \code
  export OPENMS_DATA_PATH=/usr/shared/OpenMS 
  \endcode

  @note Please note that these packages are not directly maintained by us and we can not guarantee the same behaviour as when building it on your own.
  Also their availability is subject to change and support might be limited (due to unforeseen or untested behaviour).
  
  @section build_your_own_linux Build it on your own
  Please check <a href="http://www.openms.de/">OpenMS.de</a> for details on how to obtain the source code and @subpage install_linux on how to build %OpenMS.

  @note Some thirdparty software used via adapter tools in %OpenMS might also require an installed JavaVM.

  @section docker_linux Run a (Bio)Docker image
  We are also constantly updating our <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> support.
  Images can be obtained via <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/openms/>Dockerhub</a> and <a href="http://biocontainers.pro/">Biocontainers</a> repositories.
  Depending on what you want to do, images can be pulled via one of the following commands
  \code
  docker pull biocontainers/openms
  docker pull openms/library
  docker pull openms/executables
  docker pull openms/pyopenms
  \endcode
  once you have successfully installed docker (see <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/">Docker documentation</a>).
