 @page install_mac_bin Installation on MacOS
  
   Simply download and install the MacOS drag-and-drop installer for your system from our <a href="https://abibuilder.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/archive/openms/OpenMSInstaller/release/latest">archive</a>.
   After double-clicking, accepting the "downloaded App warning" and mounting the dmg image, drag the OpenMS folder
   into your Applications folder as advised.
   CAUTION (before OpenMS 2.3): Due to new security measures since macOS Sierra 10.12, Apps of a downloaded bundle (such as TOPPView.app from OpenMS)
   are executed in a sandbox and may not find shared files required to start. If you see nothing happening after double clicking
   one of our Apps, please drag them out of the Applications/OpenMS folder and back into it (to signal the system that you trust it)!
   This issue is solved with new signed installers starting from OpenMS 2.3

   To use TOPP as regular apps in your shell just add the following lines to your <tt>~/.profile</tt> file.
   Please adapt the first line to point to the folder where you installed %OpenMS (e.g., <tt>/Applications/OpenMS-2.3.0</tt>)

     \code
     export OPENMS_TOPP_PATH=<OpenMS-PATH>
     source ${OPENMS_TOPP_PATH}/.TOPP_bash_profile
     \endcode

   <H2>Known Issues:</H2><br>
   There is a known bug with running Java based thirdparty tools (like MSGFPlusAdapter and LuciphorAdapter)
   from within TOPPAS.app. Please run the TOPPAS.app from within the Terminal.app (e.g. with the <i>open</i> command)
   to get access to the path where Java is located
   (which is usually present in the <b><i>PATH</i></b> of your Terminal).
   Advanced users can set this path in the Info.plist of/inside the TOPPAS.app.
