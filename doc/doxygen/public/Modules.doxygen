	These classes are components for clustering all kinds of data for which a distance relation, normalizable in
	the range of [0,1], is available. Mainly this will be data for which there is a corresponding CompareFunctor
	given (e.g. PeakSpectrum) that is yielding the similarity normalized in the range of [0,1] of such two
	elements, so it can easily converted to the needed distances. @see PeakSpectrumCompareFunctor.

	two new classes must be defined:

	- a "canvas" class derived from OpenMS::PlotCanvas,
	  used for painting the data.
	- a "widget" class derived from OpenMS::PlotWidget,
	  which holds the instance of the canvas class, and some
	  additional widgets, such as OpenMS::AxisWidget. This
	  class is also responsible for holding the data and for
	  providing it to the canvas class instance.
