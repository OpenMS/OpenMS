	@page TOPPAS_general General introduction

		@b TOPPAS allows you to create, edit, open, save, and run TOPP workflows. Pipelines
		can be created conveniently in a GUI. The
		parameters of all involved tools can be edited within TOPPAS
		and are also saved as part of the pipeline definition in the @p .toppas file.
		Furthermore, @b TOPPAS interactively performs validity checks during the pipeline
		editing process and before execution (i.e., a dry run of the entire pipeline),
		in order to prevent the creation of invalid workflows.
		Once set up and saved, a workflow can also be run without the GUI using
		@p ExecutePipeline @p -in @p \<file\>.
		
		The following figure shows a simple example pipeline that has just been created
		and executed successfully:
		
		@image html TOPPAS_simple_example.png
		@image latex TOPPAS_simple_example.png "" width=14cm
		

		To create a new TOPPAS file, you can either: 

			- open TOPPAS without providing any existing workflow - an empty workflow will be opened automatically
			- in a running TOPPAS program choose: @p File @p > @p New
			- create an empty file in your file browser (explorer) with the suffix @p \.toppas and double-click it (on Windows systems all @p \.toppas files are associated with TOPPAS automatically during installation of %OpenMS, on Linux and MacOS you might need to manually associate the extension)
		
	@page TOPPAS_interface User interface
		
		@section TOPPAS_interface_introduction Introduction
		
		The following figure shows the @b TOPPAS main window and a pipeline which is just being created.
		The user has added some tools by drag&dropping them from the TOPP tool list on the left
		onto the central window. Additionally, the user has added nodes
		for input and output files.
			
		Next, the user has drawn some connections between the tools
		which determine the data flow of the pipeline. Connections can be drawn by first @em deselecting the
		desired source node (by left-clicking anywhere on the white background)
		and then dragging (i.e. left-click and keep the button pressed) the mouse from the source to the target node (if
		a @em selected node is dragged, it is moved on the canvas instead).
		When a connection is created, and the source (, or the target) has more than one output (, or input) parameter,
		an input/output parameter
		mapping dialog shows up and lets the user select the output parameter of the source node and the
		input parameter of the target node for this data flow - shown here for the connection between FalseDiscoveryRate and IDFilter.
		If the file types of the selected input and output parameters are not compatible with each other,
		@b TOPPAS will refuse to add the connection. It will also refuse to add a connection if it
		would create a cycle in the workflow, or if it just would not make sense, e.g., if
		its target is an input file node. The connection between the input file node (#1) and the CometAdapter (#5)
		tool is painted yellow which indicates it is not ready yet, because no input files have been
		specified.
			
		@image html TOPPAS_edges.png
		@image latex TOPPAS_edges.png "" width=14cm
			
		The input/output mapping of connections can be changed at any time during the editing process by double-clicking
		an connections or by selecting @p Edit @p I/O @p mapping from the context menu which appears when a connection is right-clicked.
		All visible items (i.e. connections and the different kinds of nodes) have such a context menu. For a detailed list
		of the different menus and their entries, see @ref TOPPAS_interface_menus .
		
		The following figure shows a possible next step: the user has double-clicked one of the tool nodes in order
		to configure its parameters. By default, the standard parameters are used for each tool. Again, this can also
		be done by selecting @p Edit @p parameters from the context menu of the tool.
		
		@image html TOPPAS_parameters.png
		@image latex TOPPAS_parameters.png "" width=14cm
		
		Once the pipeline has been set up, the input files have to be specified before the pipeline can be executed.
		This is done by double-clicking an input node and selecting the desired files in the dialog that appears. 
		
    Input nodes have a special mode named @em "recycling mode", i.e., if the input node has fewer files than the following
		node has rounds (as it might have two incoming connections) then the files are recycled until all rounds 
		are satisfied. This might be useful if one input node specifies a single database file (for a Search-Adapter like Mascot)
		and another input node has the actual MS2 experiments (which is usually more than one). Then the database input 
		node would be set to "recycle" the database file, i.e. use it for every run of the MascotAdapter node. The input 
		list can be recycled an arbitrary number of times, but the recycling has to be @em complete, i.e. the number of rounds of the
		downstream node have to be a multiple of the number of input files. Recycling mode can be activated by right-clicking 
		the input node and selecting the according entry from the context menu.
		
    Finally, if you have input and output nodes at every end of your pipeline and all connections are green, 
		you can select @p Pipeline @p > @p Run in the menu bar or just press @p F5.

		@image html TOPPAS_run_options.png
		@image latex TOPPAS_run_options.png "" width=14cm
		
		You will be asked for an output file directory where
		a sub-directory, @p TOPPAS_out, will be created. This directory will contain your output files.
		You can also specify the number of jobs (i.e. TOPP tool invocations) that TOPPAS is allowed to run in parallel. If a number greater than 1
		is selected, TOPPAS will parallelize the pipeline execution in the following scenarios:

		- A tool has to process more than one input file, but can only handle one file at a time (as is the case for most TOPP tools; notable exceptions are MapAligners and FeatureLinkers). In this case, multiple instances of the tool are started in parallel.
		- The pipeline contains multiple branches that are independent of each other. In this case, nodes in independent branches are run in parallel.

		Be careful with this setting, however, as some of the TOPP tools require large amounts of RAM (depending
		on the size of your dataset). Running too many parallel jobs on a machine with not enough memory will cause problems.
		Also, do not confuse this setting with the @em threads parameter of the individual TOPP tools: every TOPP tool has this
		parameter specifying the maximum number of threads the tool is allowed to use (although only a subset of the TOPP tools make use
		of this parameter, since there are tasks that cannot be computed in parallel). Be especially careful with combinations
		of both parameters! If you have a pipeline containing the @em FeatureFinderCentroided, for example, and set its @em threads parameter
		to 8, and you additionally set the number of parallel jobs in @b TOPPAS to 8, then you may end up using 8*8=64 threads in parallel (if you have 8 or more input files), which
		might not be what you intended to do.

		In addition to @p TOPPAS_out, a @p TOPPAS_tmp directory will be created in the %OpenMS temp path
		(call the @em OpenMSInfo tool to see where exactly).
		It will contain all temporary files that are passed from tool to tool within the pipeline.
		Both folders contain further sub-directories which are named after the number in the top-left corner of the node they
		belong to (plus the name of the tool for temporary files). During pipeline execution, the status lights in the top-right corner of the
		tools indicate if the tool has finished successfully (green), is currently running (yellow),
		has not done anything so far (gray), is scheduled to run next (blue), or has crashed (red).
		The numbers in the bottom-right corner of every tool show how many files have already been processed and
		the overall number of files to be processed by this tool.
		When the execution has finished, you can check the generated output files of every node quickly by selecting
		@p Open @p files @p in @p TOPPView or @p Open @p containing @p folder from the context menu (right click on the node).

		@section TOPPAS_peak_picking_example Profile data processing
		
		The file @p peakpicker_tutorial.toppas contains a simple pipeline representing a
		common use case: starting with profile data, the noise is eliminated and the baseline
		is subtracted. Then, PeakPickerHiRes is used to find all peaks in the noise-filtered
		and baseline-reduced profile data.

		@section TOPPAS_id_example Identification of E. coli peptides
		
		This section describes an example identification pipeline contained in the 
		example directory, @p Ecoli_Identification.toppas. It is shipped together
		with a reduced example mzML file containing 139 MS2 spectra from an E. coli
		run on an Orbitrap instrument as well as an E. coli target-decoy database.

		We use the search engine
		Comet (Eng et al., 2012) for peptide identification. Therefore, 
		Comet must be installed and the path to the Comet executable (Comet.exe) must
		be set in the parameters of the CometAdapter node. If you installed OpenMS using our binary-package installers,
    chances are, Comet is already available on your system and in your $PATH environment variable, and the adapter will just work out of the box.
		
		- Node #1 accepts mzML files containing MS2 spectra.
		- Node #2 provides the database and is set to "recycling mode" to allow the database to be reused when there is more than one input file in node #1.
		- CometAdapter calls Comet which performs the actual search
		- FalseDiscoveryRate computes q-values for the IDs.
		- Finally, IDFilter selects only those IDs with a q-value of less than 1%.

		@image html TOPPAS_Ecoli_Identification.png
		@image latex TOPPAS_Ecoli_Identification.png "" width=12cm
		
		Extensions to this pipeline would be to do the annotation of the spectra with
		multiple search engines and combine the results afterwards, using the ConsensusID
		TOPP tool.

		The results may be exported using the TextExporter tool, for further downstream analysis with
		non-OpenMS tools.
	
		@section TOPPAS_quant_example Quantitation of BSA runs

		The simple pipeline described in this section (@p BSA_Quantitation.toppas) can be used to quantify peptides
		that occur on different runs. The example dataset contains three different bovine serum albumin (BSA) runs.
		First, FeatureFinderCentroided is called since the dataset is centroided. The
		results of the feature finding are then annotated with (existing) identification results.
		For convenience, we provide these search results (as idXML files) with an FDR of 5% in the BSA directory.

		@image html TOPPAS_BSA_Quantitation.png
		@image latex TOPPAS_BSA_Quantitation.png "" width=8cm

		Identifications are mapped to features by the IDMapper. The last step
		is performed by FeatureLinkerUnlabeled which links corresponding features. The results can be 
		used to calculate ratios, for example. The data could also be exported to a text based
		format using the TextExporter for further processing (e.g., in Microsoft Excel).
	
		The results can be opened in TOPPView. The next figures show the results in 2D 
		and 3D view, together with the feature intermediate results. One can see
		that the intensities and retention times are slightly different between
		the runs. To correct for retention times shift, a map alignment could be done, 
		either on the spectral data or on the feature data.

		@section TOPPAS_merger_example Merger and Collect nodes
		
		The following example is actually not a useful workflow but is supposed
		to demonstrate how merger and collector nodes can be used in a pipeline. Have a look at
		@p merger_tutorial.toppas:
		
		@image html TOPPAS_example_merger.png
		@image latex TOPPAS_example_merger.png "" width=14cm
		
		As its name suggests, a merger merges its incoming file lists, i.e.,
		files of all incoming edges are appended into new lists (which
		have as many elements as the merger has incoming connections). All tools this merger has outgoing
		connections to are called with these merged lists as input files. All incoming connections should
		pass the same number of files (unless the corresponding preceding tool is in recycling mode).
		
		A collector node, on the other hand, waits for all rounds to finish before concatenating all files from all
		incoming connections into one single list. It then calls the next tool with this list of files as input.
		This will happen exactly once during the entire pipeline run.
		
		In order to track what is happening, you can just open the example file and run it. When the
		pipeline execution has finished, have a look at all input and output files (e.g., select
		@p Open @p in @p TOPPView in the context menu of the input/output nodes).
		The input files are named rt_1.mzML, rt_2.mzML, ... and each contains a single
		spectrum with RT as indicated by the filename, so you can easily see which files have
		been merged together.
