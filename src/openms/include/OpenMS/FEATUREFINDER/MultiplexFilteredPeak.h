   * @brief data structure storing a single peak that passed all filters
   * 
   * Each filter result corresponds to a successful search for a particular
   * peak pattern in the centroided data. The actual m/z shifts seen in the filter
   * result might differ from the theoretical shifts listed in the peak pattern.
   * 
   * Each MultiplexFilteredPeak consists of a primary peak and a set of satellite peaks.
   * The primary peak is a peak in the mono-isotopic masstrace of the lightest peptide
   * in the multiplet. The satellite peaks are peaks that form the m/z shift pattern
   * relative to the primary peak within a retention time range rt_band_. They are the
   * evidence on which grounds a peak may pass the filters.
   *
   * Note that in both centroid and profile mode, centroided data are filtered. (One of
   * the first steps in the profile mode algorithm is the peak picking of the profile
   * data.) Consequently in both modes, centroided peaks make up a final filtered peak.
   * @see size(). In profile mode, we additional store the profile data points that make
   * up these peak. @see sizeProfile().
