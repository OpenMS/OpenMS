  /**
    @brief Extracts chromatographic peaks from a mass trace.

    Mass traces may consist of several consecutively (partly overlapping)
    eluting peaks, e.g., stemming from (almost) isobaric compounds that are
    separated by retention time. Especially in metabolomics, isomeric compounds
    with exactly the same mass but different retentional behaviour may still be
    contained in the same mass trace.
    
    This method first applies smoothing on the mass trace's intensities, then
    detects local minima/maxima in order to separate the chromatographic peaks
    from each other. Detection of maxima is performed on the smoothed
    intensities and uses a fixed peak width (given as parameter chrom_fwhm)
    within which only a single maximum is expected. Currently smoothing is
    done using SavitzkyGolay smoothing with a second order polynomial and a
    frame length of the fixed peak width.

    Depending on the "width_filtering" parameters, mass traces are filtered by
    length in seconds ("fixed" filter) or by quantile.

    The output of the algorithm is a set of chromatographic
    peaks for each mass trace, i.e. a vector of split mass traces (see @ref
    ElutionPeakDetection parameters).

    In general, a user would want to call the "detectPeaks" functions,
    potentially followed by the "filterByPeakWidth" function.
