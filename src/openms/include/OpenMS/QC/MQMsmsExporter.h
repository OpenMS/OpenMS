/**
  @brief Builds a MaxQuant msms.txt

    This class is closely related to QualityControl, it creates an msms.txt similar
    to a MaxQuant msms.txt. But not all columns of a MaxQuant file get exported.
    By the construction of an object, the column names of the msms values are added to the msms.txt.
    For the construction a valid path is needed (check out constructor) where the msms.txt can be stored.
    To fill the output msms.txt with data from the MS/MS run use the exportFeatureMap function,
    it needs a FeatureMap and the matching ConsensusMap as an input.
    To check if the created msms.txt is writable use the function isValid.
