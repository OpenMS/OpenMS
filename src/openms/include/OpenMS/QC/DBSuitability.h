  /**
  * @brief This class holds the functionality of calculating the database suitability.
  *
  * To calculate the suitability of a database for a specific mzML for identification search, it
  * is vital to perform a combined deNovo+database identification search. Meaning that the database
  * should be appended with an additional entry derived from concatenated deNovo sequences from said mzML.
  * Currently only Comet search is supported.
  *
  * This class will calculate q-values by itself and will throw an error if any q-value calculation was done beforehand.
  *
  * The algorithm parameters can be set using setParams().
  *
  * Allows for multiple usage of the compute function. The result of each call is stored internally in a vector.
  * Therefore old results will not be overridden by a new call. This vector then can be returned using getResults().
  *
  * This class serves as the library representation of @ref TOPP_DatabaseSuitability

    /**
    * @brief Computes suitability of a database used to search a mzML
    *
    * Top deNovo and top database hits from a combined deNovo+database search
    * are counted. The ratio of db hits vs all hits yields the suitability.
    * To re-rank cases, where a de novo peptide scores just higher than
    * the database peptide, a decoy cut-off is calculated. This functionality
    * can be turned off. This will result in an underestimated suitability,
    * but it can solve problems like different search engines or to few decoy hits.
    * 
    * Parameters can be set using the functionality of DefaultParamHandler.
    * Parameters are:
    *           no_rerank                   - re-ranking can be turned off with this (will be set automatically
    *                                         if no cross correlation score is found)
    *           reranking_cutoff_percentile - percentile that determines which cut-off will be returned
    *           FDR                         - q-value that should be filtered for
    *                                         Preliminary tests have shown that database suitability
    *                                         is rather stable across common FDR thresholds from 0 - 5 %
    *           keep_search_files           - temporary files created for and by the internal ID search are kept
    *           disable_correction          - disables corrected suitability calculations
    *           force                       - forces re-ranking to be done even without a cross correlation score,
    *                                         in which case the default main score is used
    *
    * The calculated suitability is then tried to be corrected. For this a correction factor for the number of found top
    * deNovo hits is calculated.
    * This is done by perfoming an additional combined identification search with a smaller sample of the database.
    * It was observed that the number of top deNovo and db hits behave linear according to the sampling ratio of the
    * database. This can be used to extrapolate the number of database hits that would be needed to get a suitability
    * of 1. This number in combination with the maximum number of deNovo hits (found with an identification search
    * where only deNovo is used as a database) can be used to calculate a correction factor like this:
    *                     #database hits for suitability of 1 / #maximum deNovo hits
    * This formula can be simplified in a way that the maximum number of deNovo hits isn't needed:
    *                     - (database hits slope) / deNovo hits slope
    * Both of these values can easily be calculated with the original suitability data in conjunction with the one sampled search.
    * 
    * Correcting the number of found top deNovo hits with this factor results in them being more comparable to the top
    * database hits. This in return results in a more linear behaviour of the suitability according to the sampling ratio.
    * The corrected suitability reflects what sampling ratio your database represents regarding to the theoretical 'perfect'
    * database. Or in other words: Your database needs to be (1 - corrected suitability) bigger to get a suitability of 1.
    *
    * Both the original suitability as well as the corrected one are reported in the result.
    *
    * Since q-values need to be calculated the identifications are taken by copy.
    * Since decoys need to be calculated for the fasta input those are taken by copy as well.
    *

      getDecoyDiff_, getDecoyCutOff_, isNovoHit_, checkScoreBetterThanThreshold_
      Reason: These functions are essential to the normal suitability calculation and if something would not work, the test for 'compute' would fail.

      extractSearchAdapterInfoFromMetaValues_, writeIniFile_, extractScore_

      runIdentificationSearch_
      Reason: This function simulates a whole workflow and testing it would be to complicated.
