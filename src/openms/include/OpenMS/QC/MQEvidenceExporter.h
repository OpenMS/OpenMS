@brief Builds a MaxQuant Evidence.txt

  This class is closely related to QualityControl, it creates an evidence.txt similar
  to a MaxQuant evidence.txt. But not all columns of a MaxQuant file get exported.
  By the construction of an object, the column names of the evidence values are added to the evidence.txt.
  For the construction a valid path is needed (check out constructor) where the evidence.txt can be stored.
  To fill the output evidence.txt with data from the MS/MS run use the exportFeatureMap function,
  it needs a FeatureMap and the matching ConsensusMap as an input.
  To check if the created evidence.txt is writable use the function isValid.
