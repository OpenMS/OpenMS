class OPENMS_DLLAPI MQEvidence
/**
@brief Builds a MaxQuant Evidence.txt

This class is closely related to QualityControl, it creates an evidence.txt similar
to a MaxQuant evidence.txt. But not all columns of a MaxQuant file get exported.
By the construction of an object, the column names of the evidence values are added to the evidence.txt.
For the construction a valid path is needed (check out constructor) where the evidence.txt can be stored.
To fill the output evidence.txt with data from the MS/MS run use the exportFeatureMap function,
it needs a FeatureMap and the matching ConsensusMap as an input.
To check if the created evidence.txt is writable use the function isValid.
