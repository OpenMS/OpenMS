    @brief A basic LC-MS feature.

    This class represents a "minimal" feature, defined by a position in RT and m/z, intensity,
    charge, quality, and annotated peptides. Most classes dealing with features will use the
    subclasses Feature or ConsensusFeature directly. However, algorithms that rely on very general
    characteristics of features can use this class to provide a unified solution for both "normal"
    features and consensus features.
