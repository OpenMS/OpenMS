In order to solve non-negative least square problems, we rely on C++ code
from

http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/bs/people/suvrit/work/progs/nnls.html

which is placed here unchanged.
To keep the namesspace clear we include the .cc file in our .cpp file (which goes into the OpenMSlib).


So *no* Makefile is required for this directory!
