@brief   Qscore : quality score for PeakGroup. This class is being updated.
   For now, simply it calculate the Qscore using a fixed weight vector.
   The weight vector has been determined by logistic regression.
   But afterwards, the training part for the Qscore should be added in here.
   Or other technique such as deep learning would be used.
   This class also contains tsv output function. The tsv file contains features of PeakGroups which are used for training.
