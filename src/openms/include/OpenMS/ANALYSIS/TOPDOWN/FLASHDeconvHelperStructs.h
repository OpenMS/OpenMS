   * @brief Wrapper struct for all the structs needed by the FLASHDeconv
   * Three structures are defined: PrecalculatedAveragine, TopPicItem, and LogMzPeak
   * i) PrecalculatedAveragine - to match observed isotopic envelope against theoretical one, theoretical envelope from
   * averagine model should be quickly calculated. To do so, precalculate averagines for different masses at the beginning of FLASHDeconv runs
   * ii) TopPicItem - represent TopPic identification. Currently used for QScore training. TopPic is the top-down proteomics identification tool (https://www.toppic.org/).
   * iii) LogMzPeak - Log transformed peak from original peak. Contains information such as charge, isotope index, and uncharged mass.
   * @see FLASHDeconvAlgorithm
