  /**
    @brief Scoring of an spectrum at the peak apex of an chromatographic elution peak.

    In DIA (data independent acquisition) / SWATH analysis, at each
    chromatographic point a full MS2 spectrum is recorded. This class allows to
    compute a number of scores based on the full MS2 spectrum available. The scores are the following:

    - isotope scores:
      -- isotope_corr: computes the correlation of each fragment ion with the
         theoretical isotope distribution. This is the pearson correlation to
         the theoretical isotope pattern weighted by the relative intensity of
         the transition (more is better).
      -- isotope_overlap: checks whether a signal at position (mz - 1) / charge
         exists and how strong it is. This would be an indication that the current
         peak is an isotopic signal of another peak. This simply counts how
         often a peak was observed that is higher than the current peak, thus
         number is then weighted by the relative intensity of the transition
         (thus less is better here).

    - massdiff score: computes the difference in ppm of the experimental signal
         to the expected signal (thus less is better)

    - b/y ion score: checks for the presence of b/y ions of the peptide in question

    - theoretical spectrum: a dotproduct and a manhattan score with a theoretical spectrum

    This class expects spectra objects that implement the OpenSWATH Spectrum
    interface. Transitions are expected to be in the light transition format
    (defined in OPENSWATHALGO/DATAACCESS/TransitionExperiment.h).
