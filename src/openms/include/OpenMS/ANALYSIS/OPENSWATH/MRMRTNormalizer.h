    retention time to write out a transformation file on how to transform the
    RT space into the normalized space.

    The principle is adapted from the following publication:
    Escher, C. et al. (2012), Using iRT, a normalized retention time for more 
    targeted measurement of peptides. Proteomics, 12: 1111-1121.
