  /**
    @brief This class filters, annotates, picks, and scores spectra (e.g., taken
    from a DDA experiment) based on a target list.

    The input experiment is expected to be a standard .mzML file.
    The input target list is expected to be a standard TraML formatted .csv file.

    The class deals with filtering and annotating only those spectra that reflect
    the characteristics described by the target list.
    The filtering is done based on the transition_name, PrecursorMz and RetentionTime.
    The spectra are smoothed and peaks are picked for each spectrum.
    The spectra are then scored based on total TIC, FWHM and SNR.
    One spectrum is chosen for each of those transitions for which at least one
    valid spectrum was found and matched.

    The user can decide to use only extractSpectra(), otherwise run the methods
    in the following order:
    annotateSpectra()
    pickSpectrum() (called once for each annotated spectrum)
    scoreSpectra()
    selectSpectra()
