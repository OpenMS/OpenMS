  /**
    @brief Compute the area, background and shape metrics of a peak.

    The area computation is performed in integratePeak() and it supports
    integration by simple sum of the intensity, integration by Simpson's rule
    implementations for an odd number of unequally spaced points or integration
    by the trapezoid rule.

    The background computation is performed in estimateBackground() and it
    supports three different approaches to baseline correction, namely
    computing a rectangular shape under the peak based on the minimum value of
    the peak borders (vertical_division_min), a rectangular shape based on the
    maximum value of the beak borders (vertical_division_max) or a trapezoidal
    shape based on a straight line between the peak borders (base_to_base).

    Peak shape metrics are computed in calculatePeakShapeMetrics() and multiple
    metrics are supported.

    The containers supported by the methods are MSChromatogram and MSSpectrum.
    
    @warning integratePeak() using Simpson's rule can result in negative areas despite
    strictly positive intensities in the input dataset. An example is given in
    the class test (see area = -665788.77).
