  /**
   * @brief Performs a Bayesian protein inference on Protein/Peptide identifications or ConsensusMap (experimental).
   * - Filters for best n PSMs per spectrum.
   * - Calculates and filters for best peptide per spectrum.
   * - Builds a k-partite graph from the structures.
   * - Finds and splits into connected components by DFS
   * - Extends the graph by adding layers from indist. protein groups, peptides with the same parents and optionally
   *   some additional layers (peptide sequence, charge, replicate -> extended model = experimental)
   * - Builds a factor graph representation of a Bayesian network using the Evergreen library
   *   See model param section. It is based on the Fido noisy-OR model with an option for
   *   regularizing the number of proteins per peptide.
   * - Performs loopy belief propagation on the graph and queries protein, protein group and/or peptide posteriors
   *   See loopy_belief_propagation param section.
   * - Learns best parameters via grid search if the parameters were not given in the param section.
   * - Writes posteriors to peptides and/or proteins and adds indistinguishable protein groups to the underlying
   *   data structures.
   * - Can make use of OpenMP to parallelize over connected components.
