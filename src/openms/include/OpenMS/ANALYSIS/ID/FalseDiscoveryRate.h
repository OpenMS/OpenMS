  /**
    @brief Calculates false discovery rates (FDR) from identifications

    Either two runs of forward and decoy database identification or one run containing both (with annotations) can be used to annotate each of the peptide hits with an FDR or q-value.

    q-values are basically only adjusted p-values, also ranging from 0 to 1, with lower values being preferable.
    When looking at the list of hits ordered by q-values, then a specific q-value of @em x means that @em x*100 percent of hits with a q-value <= @em x are expected to be false positives.

    Only simple target-decoy FDRs are supported with a formula depending on the "conservative" parameter:
    - false: (D+1)/T.
    - true: (D+1)/(T+D) [for comparison with protein level FDR in Fido mostly]
    For protein groups, a group is considered as a target when it contains at least one target protein.
    Group level FDRs assume the same score type as on protein level.

    For peptide hits, a hit is considered target also if it maps to both
    a target and a decoy protein (i.e. "target+decoy") as value in the
    "target_decoy" metavalue e.g. annotated by @ref TOPP_PeptideIndexer

    @note The parameter add_decoy_proteins currently does not affect groups
