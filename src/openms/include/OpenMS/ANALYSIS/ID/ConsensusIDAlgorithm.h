    @brief Abstract base class for all ConsensusID algorithms (that calculate a consensus from multiple ID runs).

    The main function is apply(), which aggregates several peptide identifications into one.

    Derived classes should implement apply_(), which takes a list of peptide identifications and produces a map of peptide sequences with accompanying scores (and charge states).
    Currently there are two derived classes, OpenMS::ConsensusIDAlgorithmIdentity and OpenMS::ConsensusIDAlgorithmSimilarity. They serve as abstract base classes for algorithms that score only
    identical peptide sequences together and algorithms that take similarities between peptides into account, respectively.

    See also the documentation of the TOPP tool, @ref TOPP_ConsensusID, for more information (e.g. on the @p filter: parameters).
