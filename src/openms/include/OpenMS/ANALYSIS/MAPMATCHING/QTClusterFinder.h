/**
   @brief A variant of QT clustering for the detection of feature groups.

   The algorithm accumulates all features from all input maps, then applies a
   variant of QT clustering to find groups of corresponding features. In more
   detail, every feature from every input map is considered as a potential
   cluster center. For every center, its nearest neighbors from the other input
   maps are detected and added to the potential cluster. Iteratively, the
   cluster with the highest quality is extracted and the clustering is updated.

   <b>Properties affecting the grouping</b>

   To be included in a particular cluster, a feature has to fulfill the following conditions:

   @li differences in RT and m/z from the cluster center must be below
       user-defined thresholds (@p distance_RT:max_difference and @p distance_MZ:max_difference),

   @li the charge state must match that of the cluster center (unless @p
       ignore_charge is set),

   @li if @p use_identifications is set and both the feature and the cluster
       center are annotated with peptide identifications, the identifications have
       to match.

   Every cluster contains at most one feature from each input map - namely the
   feature closest to the cluster center that meets the criteria and does not
   belong to a better cluster.

   The notion of "closeness" for features is defined by the distance function
   implemented in @ref FeatureDistance, the parameters of which can be set by
   the user.

   The quality of a cluster is computed from the number of elements in it and
   their distances to the cluster center. For more details see QTCluster.

   <b>Optimization</b>

   This algorithm includes a number of optimizations to reduce run-time:
   @li two-dimensional hashing of features,
   @li a look-up table for feature distances,
   @li a variant of QT clustering that requires only one round of clustering.
