/**
   @brief A functor class for the calculation of distances between features or consensus features.

     It implements a customizable distance function of the following form:

     @f[
     w_{RT} \cdot \left( \frac{\left| RT_1 - RT_2 \right|}{\Delta RT_{max}} \right)^{p_{RT}} +
     w_{MZ} \cdot \left( \frac{\left| MZ_1 - MZ_2 \right|}{\Delta MZ_{max}} \right)^{p_{MZ}} +
     w_{int} \cdot \left( \frac{\left| int_1 - int_2 \right|}{int_{max}} \right)^{p_{int}}
     @f]

     This function returns a normalized distance between zero and one (unless constraints are violated, see below).

     @f$ RT_i @f$, @f$ MZ_i @f$, and @f$ int_i @f$ are the RT, m/z, and intensity values of the respective feature.

     Constraints are: @f$ {\Delta RT_{max}}, {\Delta MZ_{max}} @f$ and @f$ int_{max} @f$.
     If an absolute difference exceeds the specified maximum, the behavior depends on the value used for @p check_constraints in the constructor:
     If "false" (i.e., no constraints), the distance in that dimension may become greater than 1; if "true", @ref infinity is returned as overall distance.

     @f$ {\Delta RT_{max}} @f$ and @f$ {\Delta MZ_{max}} @f$ are the maximum allowed differences in RT and m/z, respectively.
     They are specified by the parameters @p distance_RT:max_difference and @p distance_MZ:max_difference, and are used for normalization,
     i.e., the observed RT or m/z differences of the feature pair are scaled relative to this value.

     @f$ int_{max} @f$ is the intensity which yields a normalized intensity of 1. This parameter is not settable via user params,
     but is set in the constructor (via parameter @p max_intensity), since it depends on the data at hand.

     @f$ p_X @f$ is the exponent for the distance in dimension X, specified by the parameter @p distance_X:exponent.
     Normalized differences (between (0, 1) unless unconstrained) are taken to this power. This makes it possible to compare values using linear, quadratic, etc. distance.

     @f$ w_X @f$ is the weight of final distance in dimension X, specified by the parameter @p distance_X:weight. The weights can be used to increase or decrease
     the contribution of RT, m/z, or intensity in the distance function.
     (The default weight for the intensity dimension is zero, i.e. intensity is not considered by default. However, @f$ int_{max} @f$ is still a constraint and
      should be set sensibly in the c'tor.)

     By default, two features are paired only if they have the same charge state (or at least one unknown charge '0') - otherwise, @ref infinity is returned.
     This behavior can be changed by the @p ignore_charge parameter.


     @note Peptide identifications annotated to features are not taken into account here,
           because they are stored in a format that is not suitable for rapid comparison.
