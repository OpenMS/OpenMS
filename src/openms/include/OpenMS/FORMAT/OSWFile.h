  /**
    @brief This class serves for reading in and writing OpenSWATH OSW files.

    See OpenSwathOSWWriter for more functionality.

    The reader and writer returns data in a format suitable for PercolatorAdapter.
    OSW files have a flexible data structure. They contain all peptide query
    parameters of TraML/PQP files with the detected and quantified features of
    OpenSwathWorkflow (feature, feature_ms1, feature_ms2 & feature_transition).

    The OSWFile reader extracts the feature information from the OSW file for
    each level (MS1, MS2 & transition) separately and generates Percolator input
    files. For each of the three Percolator reports, OSWFile writer adds a table
    (score_ms1, score_ms2, score_transition) with the respective confidence metrics.
    These tables can be mapped to the corresponding feature tables, are very similar
    to PyProphet results and can thus be used interchangeably.
