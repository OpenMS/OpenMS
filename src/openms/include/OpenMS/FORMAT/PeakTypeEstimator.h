        @brief Estimates the peak type of the peaks in the iterator range based on intensity characteristics of up to five maxima
        
        We estimate profile vs. centroided by looking at highest five peaks in the spectrum.
        If at least two neighbouring sampling points to either side of a local maximum are found within 1 Th,
        the peak is considered a profile peak. The intensities need to decline on both shoulders.
        
        All sampling points successfully assigned as shoulder points are not considered for searching the next highest peak
        (except local minima at the end of a shoulder, which can be used for shoulders from left and right).
        
        If 5 peaks or 50% of total spectral intensity has been looked at, we compare the number of peaks hithero classified 
        as centroided (C) vs profile (P).
        If P / (C+P) > 0.75, the spectrum is considered profile; centroided otherwise.

        @note if there are less than 5 peaks in the iterator range SpectrumSettings::UNKNOWN is returned

    Below code is left for reference, for things which do not work across instrument classes, resolutions and m/z ranges 
    (in case someone wants to try and improve it)

    // this code does not work reliably, mainly on nearly-empty spectra.
    // one could just use the median of minimal distances, but that requires a magical cutoff parameter, which is hard to find
    // and will fail for extreme cases, e.g. very high m/z (where resolution is decreased and thus inter-peak spacing is large for profile data)
    // Looking at quartiles of the distribution of inter-peak spacing also does not work reliable, due to variable sampling distances over the m/z range.

    Profile distances are unimodal (with very few outliers), 
    aggregating around the sampling-interval of the instrument, e.g. 0.002 Th.
    We restrict the search to the first 100 peaks, since sampling intervals can increase drastically over m/z, thus
    distorting the unimodal model, e.g. for Orbitrap 0.0006@200 Th to 0.1@4000 Th.

    Centroided distances are multimodal, aggregating at 1, 1/2, 1/3 etc and surprisingly often near 0 as well.

    Comparing the distance between the first and third quantile of the distance distribution gives an indication
    on the type of data. The Q1 vs. Q3 only differs by a few percent [(Q1-Q3)/Q1*100 ~ 4%] we are surely looking at profile data.
    On the other hand, observing large differences (~ factor 10-100) indicates centroided data.
    We set the threshold to factor of 5, i.e. if (Q3-Q1)/Q1 < 5, it's profile data.
