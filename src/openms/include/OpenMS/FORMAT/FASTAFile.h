      @brief This class serves for reading in and writing FASTA files
      If the protein/gene sequence contains unusual symbols (such as translation end (*)),
      they will be kept!
      You can use aggregate methods load() and store() to read/write a
      set of protein sequences at the cost of memory.

      Or use single read/write of protein sequences using readStart(), readNext()
      and writeStart(), writeNext(), writeEnd() for more memory efficiency.
      Reading from one and writing to another FASTA file can be handled by
      one single FASTAFile instance.
