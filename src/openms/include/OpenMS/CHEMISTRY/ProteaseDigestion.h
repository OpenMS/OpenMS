     @brief Class for the enzymatic digestion of proteins represented as AASequence or String

     Digestion can be performed using simple regular expressions,
     e.g. [KR] | [^P]
     for trypsin. Also missed cleavages can be modeled, i.e. adjacent peptides are not cleaved
     due to enzyme malfunction/access restrictions. If @em n missed cleavages are allowed, all possible resulting
     peptides (cleaved and uncleaved) with up to @em n missed cleavages are returned.
     Thus @b no random selection of just @em n specific missed cleavage sites is performed.
