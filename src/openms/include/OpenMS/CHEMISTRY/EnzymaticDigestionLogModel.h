  /**
       @brief Class for the Log L model of enzymatic digestion of proteins

   An alternative model for tryptic digestion. where the protein is cleaved only at positions where a cleavage model
   trained on real data, exceeds a certain threshold. The model is published in
   Siepen et al. (2007), "Prediction of missed cleavage sites in tryptic peptides aids protein identification in proteomics.", doi: 10.1021/pr060507u
   The model is only available for trypsin and ignores the missed cleavage setting. You should however use setLogThreshold()
   to adjust FP vs FN rates. A higher threshold increases the number of cleavages predicted.
