       @brief Class for the enzymatic digestion of proteins

   Digestion can be performed using simple regular expressions,
   e.g. [KR] | [^P]
   for trypsin. Also missed cleavages can be modelled, i.e. adjacent peptides are not cleaved
   due to enzyme malfunction/access restrictions. If @em n missed cleavages are given, all possible resulting
   peptides (cleaved and uncleaved) with up to @em n missed cleavages are returned.
   Thus @b no random selection of just @em n specific missed cleavage sites is performed.

   An alternative model is also available, where the protein is cleaved only at positions where a cleavage model
   trained on real data, exceeds a certain threshold. The model is published in
   Siepen et al. (2007), "Prediction of missed cleavage sites in tryptic peptides aids protein identification in proteomics.", doi: 10.1021/pr060507u
   The model is only available for trypsin and ignores the missed cleavage setting. You should however use setLogThreshold()
   to adjust FP vs FN rates. A higher threshold increases the number of cleavages predicted.
