      @brief database which holds all residue modifications from UniMod

      This singleton class serves as a storage of the available modifications
      represented by UniMod (www.unimod.org). The modifications are identified
      by their name and possibly other IDs from UniMod or the PSI-MOD ontology.
      Modifications can have different specificities, e.g. they can occur only
      at the termini, anywhere or only at specific amino acids.

      The modifications are defined in share/OpenMS/CHEMISTRY/unimod.xml and
      in share/OpenMS/CHEMISTRY/PSI-MOD.obo. The unimod file can be directly
      downloaded from unimod.org and replaced if the modifications change.

      To add a new modification, not contained in UniMod, one should follow
      the way described at the unimod.org website and download the file then
      from unimod.org. The same can be done to add support for the modifications
      to search engines, e.g. Mascot.

      In some scenarios, it might be useful to define different modification
      databases. This can be done by providing a path through
      initializeModificationsDB(), however it is important that this is done
      *before* the first call to getInstance().
