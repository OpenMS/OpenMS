  /**
      @brief A 2-dimensional hull representation in [counter]clockwise direction - depending on axis labelling.

      The current implementation does not guarantee to produce convex hulls.
      It can still store 'old' convex hulls from featureXML without problems, but does not support the enclose() query in this case,
      and you will get an exception. As an alternative, you can use my_hull.getBoundingBox().encloses(), which yields similar results,
      and will always work.

      If you are creating new hull from peaks (e.g. during FeatureFinding), the generated hulls of a feature are defined as
      a range in m/z dimension for each RT scan (thus might be non-convex). This has the advantage that one can clearly see
      where points range within each scan (although missing points within this range are still not shown).
      When hulls are created like this, the encloses() function is supported, and works as expected, i.e.
      for the shape defined by this hull (view it in TOPPView) it answers whether the point is inside the shape.
  However, once you store the hull in featureXML and load it again, the encloses() function is not supported any longer, because
  the old convex hulls did not save min&max for each scan.
  (to support encloses() at least for the new hulls, one would need to check if there exists a min&max value for each scan
   --> then the query would be valid and the inner representation can be filled. Old featureXML's are not supported in any case.)

      The outer hullpoints can be queried by getHullPoints().

      @improvement For chromatograms we could postprocess the input and remove points in intermediate RT scans,
      which are currently reported but make the number of points rather large.
