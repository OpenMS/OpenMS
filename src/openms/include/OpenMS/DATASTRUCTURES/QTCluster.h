/**
     @brief A representation of a QT cluster used for feature grouping.

     Ultimately, a cluster represents a group of corresponding features (or consensus features) from different input maps (feature maps or consensus maps).

     Clusters are defined by their center points (one feature each). A cluster also stores a number of potential cluster elements (other features) from different input maps, together with their distances to the cluster center.
     Every feature that satisfies certain constraints with respect to the cluster center is a @e potential cluster element. However, since a feature group can only contain one feature from each input map, only the "best" (i.e. closest to the cluster center) such feature is considered a true cluster element.

     The QT clustering algorithm has the characteristic of initially producing all possible, overlapping clusters. Iteratively, the best cluster is then extracted and the clustering is recomputed for the remaining points.

     In our implementation, multiple rounds of clustering are not necessary. Instead, the clustering is updated in each iteration. This is the reason for storing all potential cluster elements: When a certain cluster is finalized, its elements have to be removed from the remaining clusters, and affected clusters change their composition. (Note that clusters can also be invalidated by this, if the cluster center is being removed.)

     The quality of a cluster is the normalized average distance to the cluster center for present and missing cluster elements. The distance value for missing elements (if the cluster contains no feature from a certain input map) is the user-defined threshold that marks the maximum allowed radius of a cluster.
