	==================== encodeInt ====================
	Some of the encodings described below use a integer compression referred to simply as 
	
	encodeInt()
 
	The algorithm is similar to other variable length integer encodings,
	such as the SQLite Variable-Length Integers encoding, but it uses half
	bytes in its encoding procedure.

	This encoding works on a 4 byte integer, by truncating initial zeros or ones.
	If the initial (most significant) half byte is 0x0 or 0xf, the number of such 
	halfbytes starting from the most significant is stored in a halfbyte. This initial 
	count is then followed by the rest of the ints halfbytes, in little-endian order. 
	A count halfbyte c of

		0 <= c <= 8 		is interpreted as an initial c 		0x0 halfbytes 
		9 <= c <= 15		is interpreted as an initial (c-8) 	0xf halfbytes

	Example:

	int		c		rest
	0 	=> 	0x8
	-1	=>	0xf		0xf
	 2	=>	0x7		0x2
	23	=>	0x6 	0x7	0x1
	2047	=>	0x5 	0xf 0xf	0xf

	Note that the algorithm returns a char array in which the half bytes are
	stored in the lower 4 bits of each element. Since the first element is a
	count half byte, the maximal length of the encoded data is 9 half bytes
	(1 count half byte + 8 half bytes for a 4-byte integer).
