  /**
         @brief This class implements a peak picking algorithm using wavelet techniques

         The algorithm is described in detail in Lange et al. (2006) Proc. PSB-06.

         This peak picking algorithm uses the continuous wavelet transform of a profile data signal to detect mass peaks.
         Afterwards a given asymmetric peak function is fitted to the profile data and important peak parameters (e.g. fwhm)
         are extracted.
         In an optional step these parameters can be optimized using a non-linear optimization method.

         The peak parameters are stored in the meta data arrays of the spectra (see MSSpectrum) in this order:
         - rValue
         - area
         - fwhm
         - leftWidth
         - rightWidth
         - peakShape
         - SignalToNoise
         .

         @note The peaks must be sorted according to ascending m/z!
