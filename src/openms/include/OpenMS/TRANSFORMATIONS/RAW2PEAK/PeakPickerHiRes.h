  /**
    @brief This class implements a fast peak-picking algorithm best suited for
    high resolution MS data (FT-ICR-MS, Orbitrap). In high resolution data, the
    signals of ions with similar mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) exhibit little or
    no overlapping and therefore allow for a clear separation. Furthermore, ion
    signals tend to show well-defined peak shapes with narrow peak width.

    This peak-picking algorithm detects ion signals in profile data and
    reconstructs the corresponding peak shape by cubic spline interpolation.
    Signal detection depends on the signal-to-noise ratio which is adjustable
    by the user (see parameter signal_to_noise). A picked peak's m/z and
    intensity value is given by the maximum of the underlying peak spline.

    So far, this peak picker was mainly tested on high resolution data. With
    appropriate preprocessing steps (e.g. noise reduction and baseline
    subtraction), it might be also applied to low resolution data.

    This implementation performs peak picking in a single dimension (m/z);
    two-dimensional data such as ion mobility separated data needs additional
    pre-processing. The current implementation treats these data as
    one-dimensional data, performs peak picking in the m/z dimension and
    reports the intensity weighted ion mobility of the picked peaks (which will
    produce correct results if the data has been binned previously but
    incorrect results if fully 2D data is provided as input).

    @note The peaks must be sorted according to ascending m/z!
