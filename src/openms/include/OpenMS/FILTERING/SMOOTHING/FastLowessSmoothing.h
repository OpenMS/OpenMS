  /**
    @brief LOWESS (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing).

    A non-parametric smoothing technique that fits a simple linear regression
    model to localized subsets of the data, point by point. This is often used
    for retention time alignments.

    The implementation here is optimized for speed and many datapoints.  Note
    that it performs a linear fit, it does not implement quadratic fits. It is
    based on the initial FORTRAN code by W. S. Cleveland published at NETLIB. 

    Note that this should work best for for large datasets with mostly linear
    behavior. For small datasets with non-linear behavior, use the
    LowessSmoothing class.

      @brief Computes a lowess smoothing fit on the input vectors

      This is a fast implementation of a lowess fit that is based on the original
      Fortran code by W. S. Cleveland and it uses some optimizations. 

      @param x The input vector in the first dimension
      @param y The input vector in the second dimension
      @param f Fraction of datapoints to use for each local regression (the span, recommended value: 2/3) 
      @param nsteps The number of robustifying iterations (recommended value: 3)
      @param delta nonnegative parameter which may be used to save computations (recommended value: 0.01 * range of x)
      @param result Result of fit

      \pre The size of the vectors x and y needs to be equal
      \pre The vector needs to have at least 2 elements
      \pre The vector x needs to be sorted
      \pre The f value needs to be between 0 and 1
      \pre The nsteps parameter needs to be zero or larger
      \pre The delta parameter needs to be zero or larger

      The delta parameter allows the algorithm to not perform the regression at
      every data point, as it assumes that points that are close to each other
      will have the same regression parameters. A linear interpolation is used
      to fill in the skipped points, larger values lead to increased speed up.

      The f parameter allows the caller to influence the smoothness. A larger
      values will increase smoothness (recommended value: 2/3) It is the
      fraction of points used to compute each fitted value. Choosing F in the
      range .2 to .8 usually results in a good fit

      The nsteps parameter controls how many iterations are performed in the
      robust fit (setting it to zero turns off the robust fit and the nonrobust
      fit is returned). A value of 2 or 3 should be sufficient for most purposes.
