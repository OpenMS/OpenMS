  /**
    @brief Method for the assembly of mass traces belonging to the same isotope
    pattern, i.e., that are compatible in retention times, mass-to-charge ratios,
    and isotope abundances.

    In @ref FeatureFindingMetabo, mass traces detected by the @ref
    MassTraceDetection method and afterwards split into individual
    chromatographic peaks by the @ref ElutionPeakDetection method are assembled
    to composite features if they are compatible with respect to RTs, m/z ratios,
    and isotopic intensities. To this end, feature hypotheses are formulated
    exhaustively based on the set of mass traces detected within a local RT and
    m/z region. These feature hypotheses are scored by their similarity to real
    metabolite isotope patterns. The score is derived from independent models for
    retention time shifts and m/z differences between isotopic mass traces.
    Hypotheses with correct or false isotopic abundances are distinguished by a
    SVM model. Mass traces that could not be assembled or low-intensity
    metabolites with only a monoisotopic mass trace to observe are left in the
    resulting @ref FeatureMap as singletons with the undefined charge state of 0.
