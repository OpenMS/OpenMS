    @brief Create and apply models of a mass recalibration function.

    The input is a list of calibration points (ideally spanning a wide m/z range to prevent extrapolation when applying to model).
    
    Models (LINEAR, LINEAR_WEIGHTED, QUADRATIC, QUADRATIC_WEIGHTED) can be trained using CalData points (or a subset of them).
    Calibration points can have different retention time points, and a model should be build such that it captures
    the local (in time) decalibration of the instrument, i.e. choose appropriate time windows along RT to calibrate the
    spectra in this RT region.
    From the available calibrant data, a model is build. Later, any uncalibrated m/z value can be fed to the model, to obtain
    a calibrated m/z.

    The input domain can either be absolute mass differences in [Th], or relative differences in [ppm].
    The models are build based on this input.

    Outlier detection before model building via the RANSAC algorithm is supported for LINEAR and QUADRATIC models.
