      @brief The interface of a consumer of spectra and chromatograms

      The data consumer is able to consume data of type MSSpectrum and
      MSChromatogram and process them (it may modify the spectra). The consumer
      interface may be used when data is generated sequentially (e.g. by
      reading from disc) and needs to be processed as fast as possible without
      ever holding the full set of data in memory.

      The consumer expects to be informed about the number of spectra and
      chromatograms to consume and potentially about the ExperimentalSettings
      @a before_consuming any spectra. This can be critical for consumers who
      write data to disk. Depending on the implementation, an exception may
      occur if the ExperimentalSettings and the size of the experiment are not
      set before consuming any spectra.

      Implementations in OpenMS can be found in OpenMS/FORMAT/DATAACCESS

      @note The member functions setExpectedSize and setExperimentalSettings
      are expected to be called before consuming starts.
