  /**
      @brief Version information class.

      The OpenMS release version and revision data can be retrieved as a string
      or as integers.

      Note that the term <i>"version"</i> refers to releases (such as 1.0,
      1.1.1-alpha, 1.2, ...), which follows the https://semver.org/ definition
      of version numbers using major, minor, patch and pre-release identifiers
      (separated by a dash).
      The term <i>"revision"</i> refers to a revision control system
      such as git and is mainly of interest for developers. The term <i>"branch"</i>
      refers to the git branch that this build of OpenMS is based on.

      The VersionInfo class contains only static methods.
