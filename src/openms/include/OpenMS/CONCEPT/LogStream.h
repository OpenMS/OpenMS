    @brief Log streams

    Logging, filtering, and storing messages.
    Many programs emit warning messages, error messages, or simply
    information and remarks to their users. The  LogStream
    class provides a convenient and straight-forward interface
    to classify these messages according to their importance
    (via the loglevel), filter and store them in files or
    write them to streams. \par
    As the LogStream class is derived from ostream, it behaves
    as any ostream object. Additionally you may associate
    streams with each LogStream object that catch only
    messages of certain loglevels. So the user might decide to
    redirect all error messages to cerr, all warning messages
    to cout and all information to a file. \par
    Along with each message its time of creation and its loglevel
    is stored. So the user might also decide to store all
    errors he got in the last two hours or alike. \par
    The LogStream class heavily relies on the LogStreamBuf
    class, which does the actual buffering and storing, but is only
    of interest if you want to implement a derived class, as the
    actual user interface is implemented in the LogStream class.

      @brief Stream buffer used by LogStream.

      This class implements the low level behavior of
      LogStream . It takes care of the buffers and stores
      the lines written into the LogStream object.
      It also contains a list of streams that are associated with
      the LogStream object. This list contains pointers to the
      streams and their minimum and maximum log level.
      Each line entered in the LogStream is marked with its
      time (in fact, the time LogStreamBuf::sync was called) and its
      loglevel. The loglevel is determined by either the current
      loglevel (as set by  LogStream::setLevel or a temporary
      level (as set by LogStream::level for a single line only).
      For each line stored, the list of associated streams is checked
      whether the loglevel falls into the range declared by the
      stream's minimum and maximum level. If this condition is met,
      the logline (with its prefix, see  LogStream::setPrefix )
      is also copied to the associated stream and this stream is
      flushed, too.

    /**
      @brief Log Stream Class.

      Defines a log stream which features a cache and some formatting.
      For the developer, however, only some macros are of interest which
      will push the message that follows them into the
      appropriate stream:

      Macros:
        - OPENMS_LOG_FATAL_ERROR
        - OPENMS_LOG_ERROR (non-fatal error are reported (processing continues))
        - OPENMS_LOG_WARN  (warning, a piece of information which should be read by the user, should be logged)
        - OPENMS_LOG_INFO (information, e.g. a status should be reported)
        - OPENMS_LOG_DEBUG (general debugging information -  output be written to cout if debug_level > 0)

      To use a specific logger of a log level simply use it as cerr or cout: <br>
      <code> OPENMS_LOG_ERROR << " A bad error occurred ..."  </code>
      <br>
      Which produces an error message in the log.

      @note The log stream macros are thread safe and can be used in a
      multithreaded environment, the global variables are not! The macros are
      protected by a OPENMS_THREAD_CRITICAL directive (which translates to an
      OpenMP critical pragma), however there may be a small performance penalty
      to this.
