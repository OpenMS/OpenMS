Description: Input / Output abstraction module.
 The stream module has two main aspects: (1) The Stream concept for abstracting
 I/O and (2) The record and document I/O concept.
 .
 It contains implementations for both concepts: Adaptions from the <cstdio>
 FILE* stream and streams from the IOstreams library to the Stream concept and
 wrapper classes for reading and writing .gz and .bz2 files (if available).
 Implementations of the record reader class are available for Streams and memory
 mapped strings.
 .
 Furthermore, it provides record and documentation reading functionality for
 FASTA and FASTQ files.
 .
 Demos:
 .
 benchmark_stream  FASTA input/output using all stream implementations and
 also demonstrates how to use the SEQAN_HAS* macros defined in this module to
 conditionally enable .gz and .bz2 support.
