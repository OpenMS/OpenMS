This is the source distribution for the NCAR/EOL BSpline 
library. 

--Background--

The BSpline package provides an implementation of 
a Cubic B-Spline method devised by Vic Ooyama, and brought 
to our attention by James Franklin. Franklin employed 
the B-Spline for general purpose filtering in his
dropsonde quality control processing program, known
as "editsonde".

NCAR used Franklin's code, and a paper published 
by Ooyama, to build this generic B-Spline class 
library.

--Legal--

See the COPYRIGHT file in the source distribution.

--Requirements--

BSpline builds on Windows, Linux and Mac. Build environments
for each operating system are:

Windows: Microsoft Visual Studio 2005
Linux: scons and g++
Mac: scons and g++ (both provided by Xcode)

BSpline uses the doxygen documentation system. Doxygen is not required to
build BSpline, but if available it can be used to create html
documentation.

--Organization--

BSpline/ - contains the source code to create a bspline library,
and a header file to access the BSpline from your code.

Tests/ - contains several subdirectories with code for evaluating
the code. The C++ directory is the only one that is currently compiled
and known to work. The R directory contains code for plotting
results using the R statistical langauge. The Fortran directory contains
code for some unknown application.

Design/ - Contains notes and and some original Ooyama code.

--Building--

Linux/Mac:
Scons (http://www.scons.org) is used to build BSpline.

BSpline is built by running scons in the top directory:
    scons

This will create BSpline/libbspline.a and Tests/C++/bspline. The librry 
will contain float and double instantiations of the BSpline
templates.

Windows: 
A Visual Studio solution (bspline.sln) is provided for building the
same products.

--Documentation--
The BSpline code is documented using the Doxygen embedded comments.
Run doxygen in the top directory, where it will find the 
Doxygen configuration file:
   doxygen
   
This will produce html formatted documentation in the doc/ directory.
Open doc/index.html with your favorite browser.
