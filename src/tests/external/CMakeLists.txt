## are used as IMPORTED targets
## Currently this affects only Qt and since we do not build GUI stuff here, we only need to find QtCore and Network
## At some point we want IMPORTED targets only, since this will make it relocatable. Until then, CMake should find a way
## to automate adding the aforementioned find_dependency calls during export.
