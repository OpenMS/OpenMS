## TODO: we should add find_dependency calls to our autogenerated OpenMSConfig.cmake
## Until then, developers need to figure out themselves which dependencies are currently needed since they
## are used as IMPORTED targets
## Currently this affects only Qt and since we do not build GUI stuff here, we only need to find QtCore and Network
## At some point we want IMPORTED targets only, since this will make it relocatable. Until then, CMake should find a way
## to automate adding the aforementioned find_dependency calls during export.

## Same here. This should be made optional somehow. Figure out how to do that. And figure out, why on macOS it works already.
