      input to them. To do that we pre-schedule the input in the main event loop

      is then issued when the time out occurs, given that the current window has the correct
      @p title! Otherwise the event is rescheduled until the title is correct.
      The @p delay then the timer pops is relative to the last timed events successfull completion.
