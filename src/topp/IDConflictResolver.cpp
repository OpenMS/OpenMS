The peptide identifications are filtered so that only one identification
with a single hit (with the best score) is associated to each feature. (If
two IDs have the same best score, either one of them may be selected.)

The the filtered identifications are added to the vector of unassigned peptides
and also reduced to a single best hit.

This step may be useful before applying @ref TOPP_ProteinQuantifier
"ProteinQuantifier", because features with ambiguous annotation are not
considered for the quantification.
