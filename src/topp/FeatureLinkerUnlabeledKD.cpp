 @brief Group corresponding features across labelfree experiments.

 Group corresponding features across labelfree experiments. This tool
 produces results similar to those of FeatureLinkerUnlabeledQT, since it
 optimizes a similar objective. However, this algorithm is more efficient
 than FLQT as it uses a kd-tree for fast 2D region queries in m/z - RT space
 and a sorted binary search tree to choose the best cluster among the remaining
 ones in O(1). Insertion and searching in this tree have O(log n) runtime.
 KD-tree insertion and search have O(log n) runtime. The overall complexity of
 the algorithm is O(n log(n)) time and O(n) space.

 In practice, the runtime of FeatureLinkerUnlabeledQT is often not
 significantly worse than that of FeatureLinkerUnlabeledKD if the datasets
 are relatively small and/or the value of the -nr_partitions parameter is
 chosen large enough. If, however, the datasets are very large, and especially
 if they are so dense that a partitioning based on the specified m/z
 tolerance is not possible anymore, then this algorithm becomes orders of
 magnitudes faster than FLQT.

 Notably, this algorithm can be used to align featureXML files containing
 unassembled mass traces (as produced by MassTraceExtractor), which is often
 impossible for reasonably large datasets using other aligners, as these
 datasets tend to be too dense and hence cannot be partitioned.

 Prior to feature linking, this tool performs an (optional) retention time
 transformation on the features using LOWESS regression in order to minimize
 retention time differences between corresponding features across different
 maps. These transformed RTs are used only internally. In the results, original
 RTs will be reported.
