            #  This class implements a fast peak-picking algorithm best suited for
            #  high resolution MS data (FT-ICR-MS, Orbitrap). In high resolution data, the
            #  signals of ions with similar mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) exhibit little or
            #  no overlapping and therefore allow for a clear separation. Furthermore, ion
            #  signals tend to show well-defined peak shapes with narrow peak width
            #  
            #  This peak-picking algorithm detects ion signals in raw data and
            #  reconstructs the corresponding peak shape by cubic spline interpolation.
            #  Signal detection depends on the signal-to-noise ratio which is adjustable
            #  by the user (see parameter signal_to_noise). A picked peak's m/z and
            #  intensity value is given by the maximum of the underlying peak spline
            #  
            #  So far, this peak picker was mainly tested on high resolution data. With
            #  appropriate preprocessing steps (e.g. noise reduction and baseline
            #  subtraction), it might be also applied to low resolution data
