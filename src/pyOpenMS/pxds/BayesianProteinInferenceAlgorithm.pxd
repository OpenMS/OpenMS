        #  Performs a Bayesian protein inference on Protein/Peptide identifications or ConsensusMap.
        #  
        #  - Filters for best n PSMs per spectrum.
        #  - Calculates and filters for best peptide per spectrum.
        #  - Builds a k-partite graph from the structures.
        #  - Finds and splits into connected components by DFS
        #  - Extends the graph by adding layers from indist. protein groups, peptides with the same parents and optionally
        #    some additional layers (peptide sequence, charge, replicate -> extended model = experimental)
        #  - Builds a factor graph representation of a Bayesian network using the Evergreen library
        #    See model param section. It is based on the Fido noisy-OR model with an option for
        #    regularizing the number of proteins per peptide.
        #  - Performs loopy belief propagation on the graph and queries protein, protein group and/or peptide posteriors
        #    See loopy_belief_propagation param section.
        #  - Learns best parameters via grid search if the parameters were not given in the param section.
        #  - Writes posteriors to peptides and/or proteins and adds indistinguishable protein groups to the underlying
        #    data structures.
        #  - Can make use of OpenMP to parallelize over connected components.
