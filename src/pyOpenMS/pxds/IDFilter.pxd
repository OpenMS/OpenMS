                #  This class provides functions for filtering collections of peptide or protein identifications according to various criteria.
                #  It also contains helper functions and classes (functors that implement predicates) that are used in this context.\n
                #  
                #  The filter functions modify their inputs, rather than creating filtered copies.\n

                #  Most filters work on the hit level, i.e. they remove peptide or protein hits from peptide or protein identifications (IDs).
                #  A few filters work on the ID level instead, i.e. they remove peptide or protein IDs from vectors thereof.
                #  Independent of this, the inputs for all filter functions are vectors of IDs, because the data most often comes in this form.
                #  This design also allows many helper objects to be set up only once per vector, rather than once per ID.\n

                #  They only carry out their specific filtering operations.
                #  This is so filters can be chained without having to repeat clean-up operations.
                #  The group of clean-up functions provides helpers that are useful to ensure data integrity after filters have been applied, but it is up to the individual developer to use them when necessary.\n
