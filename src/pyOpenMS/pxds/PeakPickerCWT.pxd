        #  This class implements a peak picking algorithm using wavelet techniques
        #  
        #  The algorithm is described in detail in Lange et al. (2006) Proc. PSB-06
        #  
        #  This peak picking algorithm uses the continuous wavelet transform of a profile data signal to detect mass peaks.
        #  Afterwards a given asymmetric peak function is fitted to the profile data and important peak parameters (e.g. fwhm)
        #  are extracted
        #  In an optional step these parameters can be optimized using a non-linear optimization method
        #  
        #  The peak parameters are stored in the meta data arrays of the spectra (see MSSpectrum) in this order:
        #  - rValue
        #  - area
        #  - fwhm
        #  - leftWidth
        #  - rightWidth
        #  - peakShape
        #  - SignalToNoise

                #  can be used as the peak_width parameter for picking the complete data set.
                #  Typically, the number of peaks increases with decreasing peak width until a plateau
                #  is reached. The beginning of this plateau is our estimate for the peak width.
                #  This estimate is averaged over several spectra
