        #      Scoring function is the m/z distance between peaks. Intensity does not play a role!
        #  Method 2: If relative tolerance (ppm) is specified a simple matching of peaks is performed:
        #  Peaks from s1 (usually the theoretical spectrum) are assigned to the closest peak in s2 if it lies in the tolerance window
        #  
        #  note: A peak in s2 can be matched to none, one or multiple peaks in s1. Peaks in s1 may be matched to none or one peak in s2
