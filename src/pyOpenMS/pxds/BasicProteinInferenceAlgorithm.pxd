        # wrap-doc:
        #  Algorithm class that implements simple protein inference by aggregation of peptide scores.
        #  
        #  It has multiple parameter options like the aggregation method, when to distinguish peptidoforms,
        #  and if you want to use shared peptides ("use_shared_peptides").
        #  First, the best PSM per spectrum is used, then only the best PSM per peptidoform is aggregated.
        #  Peptidoforms can optionally be distinguished via the treat_X_separate parameters:
        #  - Modifications (modified sequence string)
        #  - Charge states
        #  The algorithm assumes posteriors or posterior error probabilities and converts to posteriors initially.
        #  Possible aggregation methods that can be set via the parameter "aggregation_method" are:
        #  - "best" (default)
        #  - "sum"
        #  - "product" (ignoring zeroes)
        #  Annotation of the number of peptides used for aggregation can be disabled (see parameters).
        #  Supports multiple runs but goes through them one by one iterating over the full PeptideIdentification vector.
        #  Warning: Does not "link" the peptides to the resulting protein run. If you wish to do that you have to do
        #  it manually.
