        #  Representation of a digestion enzyme for RNA (RNase)
        #  
        #  The cutting sites of these enzymes are defined using two different mechanisms:
        #  First, a single regular expression that is applied to strings of unmodified RNA sequence and defines cutting sites via zero-length matches (using lookahead/lookbehind assertions).
        #  This is the same mechanism that is used for proteases (see ProteaseDigestion).
        #  However, due to the complex notation involved, this approach is not practical for modification-aware digestion.
        #  Thus, the second mechanism uses two regular expressions ("cuts after"/"cuts before"), which are applied to the short codes (e.g. "m6A") of sequential ribonucleotides.
        #  If both expressions match, then there is a cutting site between the two ribonucleotides.
        #  
        #  There is support for terminal (5'/3') modifications that may be generated on fragments as a result of RNase cleavage.
        #  A typical example is 3'-phosphate, resulting from cleavage of the phosphate backbone.
