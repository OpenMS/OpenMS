            #  Predict peak heights of peptides based on Local Linear Map model
            #  
            #  This class can be used for predictions of peptide peak heights
            #  (referred to as intensities) from a peptide sequence
            #  by a Local Linear Map (LLM) model

            #  
            #  The predictor performs only on the peptides sequences as an AASequence representation. Every sequence is
            #  transformed to an 18 dimensional data vector representing certain
            #  chemical characteristics and is loaded into the trained LocalLinearMap model to
            #  find the predicted peptides peak intensity
            #  
            #  Every predictor object calls the appropriate LocalLinearMap model, transforms
            #  the given sequences and creates a vector space in which the LocalLinearMap
            #  performs
