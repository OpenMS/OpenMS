n = will probably not be wrapped (even though technically possible - most likely deprecated code, abstract base class or some other reason - 14 TOPP tools, 15 Utils)
x = cannot not be wrapped (too much code in TOPP tools; 32 TOPP tools, 16 Utils)
xx = is not yet wrapped, must be done (5 TOPP tools, no Utils)
ok = is done (42 TOPP tools out of 98 are currently ok, plus 8 utils)

The TOPP tools are divided into several subgroups:

# In general, file handling is wrapped by FORMAT/ file handlers. Currently wrapped are the following formats:
- ConsensusXML
- FeatureXML
- IdXML
- ParamXML
- PepXML
- TransformationXML
- TraML
- MzData
- MzML
- MzQuantML
- MzXML

x  FileConverter - Converts between different MS file formats. # all in tool
x  FileFilter - Extracts or manipulates portions of data from peak, feature or consensus feature files. # all in tool
x  FileInfo - Shows basic information about the file, such as data ranges and file type. # all in tool
x  FileMerger - Merges several MS files into one file. # all in tool
x  IDMerger - Merges several protein/peptide identification files into one file. # all in tool
x  IDFileConverter - Converts identification engine file formats. # all in tool

## no wrapping of graphical tools
Graphical Tools

TOPPView - A viewer for mass spectrometry data.
TOPPAS - An assistant for GUI-driven TOPP workflow design.
