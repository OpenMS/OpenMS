      @brief A container for all visual items of a TOPPAS workflow

      TOPPASScene is a subclass of QGraphicsScene and acts as a container for all visual items
      (i.e. all vertices and edges). It is visualized by a TOPPASWidget (a subclass of QGraphicsView).
      This class also provides large parts of the functionality of TOPPAS, e.g., the methods for loading,
      saving, running, and aborting pipelines are located here.

      TOPPASScene can also be used without a visualizing TOPPASWidget (i.e., without a gui) which can
      be indicated via the constructor. In this case, the signals for log message output are connected
      to standard out. This is utilized for the ExecutePipeline tool.

  Temporary files of the pipeline are stored in the member tmp_path_. Update it when loading a pipeline which has
  tmp data from an old run. TOPPASToolVertex will ask its parent scene() whenever it wants to know the tmp directory.
