  algorithm__labels:
    doc: "Labels used for labelling the samples. If the sample is unlabelled (i.e. you want to detect only single peptide features) please leave this parameter empty. [...] specifies the labels for a single sample. For example\n\n[][Lys8,Arg10]        ... SILAC\n[][Lys4,Arg6][Lys8,Arg10]        ... triple-SILAC\n[Dimethyl0][Dimethyl6]        ...

    doc: "Range of charge states in the sample, i.e. min charge : max charge."
    type: string?
  algorithm__isotopes_per_peptide:
    doc: "Range of isotopes per peptide in the sample. For example 3:6, if isotopic peptide patterns in the sample consist of either three, four, five or six isotopic peaks. "
    type: string?
  algorithm__rt_typical:
    doc: Typical retention time [s] over which a characteristic peptide elutes. (This is not an upper bound. Peptides that elute for longer will be reported.)
    type: double?
  algorithm__rt_band:
    doc: The algorithm searches for characteristic isotopic peak patterns, spectrum by spectrum. For some low-intensity peptides, an important peak might be missing in one spectrum but be present in one of the neighbouring ones. The algorithm takes a bundle of neighbouring spectra with width rt_band into account. For example with rt_band = 0, all characteristic isotopic peaks have to be present in one and the same spectrum. As rt_band increases, the sensitivity of the algorithm but also the likelihood of false detections increases.
    type: double?
  algorithm__rt_min:
    doc: Lower bound for the retention time [s]. (Any peptides seen for a shorter time period are not reported.)
    type: double?
  algorithm__mz_tolerance:

    type: double?
  algorithm__mz_unit:
    doc: Unit of the 'mz_tolerance' parameter.
    type: string?
  algorithm__intensity_cutoff:
    doc: Lower bound for the intensity of isotopic peaks.
    type: double?
  algorithm__peptide_similarity:
    doc: Two peptides in a multiplet are expected to have the same isotopic pattern. This parameter is a lower bound on their similarity.
    type: double?
  algorithm__averagine_similarity:
    doc: The isotopic pattern of a peptide should resemble the averagine model at this m/z position. This parameter is a lower bound on similarity between measured isotopic pattern and the averagine model.
    type: double?
  algorithm__averagine_similarity_scaling:
    doc: Let x denote this scaling factor, and p the averagine similarity parameter. For the detection of single peptides, the averagine parameter p is replaced by p' = p + x(1-p), i.e. x = 0 -> p' = p and x = 1 -> p' = 1. (For knock_out = true, peptide doublets and singlets are detected simultaneously. For singlets, the peptide similarity filter is irreleavant. In order to compensate for this 'missing filter', the averagine parameter p is replaced by the more restrictive p' when searching for singlets.)
    type: double?
  algorithm__missed_cleavages:
    doc: Maximum number of missed cleavages due to incomplete digestion. (Only relevant if enzymatic cutting site coincides with labelling site. For example, Arg/Lys in the case of trypsin digestion and SILAC labelling.)

  algorithm__spectrum_type:
    doc: Type of MS1 spectra in input mzML file. 'automatic' determines the spectrum type directly from the input mzML file.
