  PeptideIndexing__decoy_string:
    doc: String that was appended (or prefixed - see 'decoy_string_position' flag below) to the accessions in the protein database to indicate decoy proteins. If empty (default), it's determined automatically (checking for common terms, both as prefix and suffix).
    type: string?
  PeptideIndexing__decoy_string_position:
    doc: Is the 'decoy_string' prepended (prefix) or appended (suffix) to the protein accession? (ignored if decoy_string is empty)
    type: string?
  PeptideIndexing__missing_decoy_action:
    doc: "Action to take if NO peptide was assigned to a decoy protein (which indicates wrong database or decoy string): 'error' (exit with error, no output), 'warn' (exit with success, warning message), 'silent' (no action is taken, not even a warning)"

  PeptideIndexing__write_protein_sequence:
    doc: If set, the protein sequences are stored as well.
    type: boolean?

    doc: If set, the protein description is stored as well.
    type: boolean?
  PeptideIndexing__keep_unreferenced_proteins:
    doc: If set, protein hits which are not referenced by any peptide are kept.
    type: boolean?
  PeptideIndexing__unmatched_action:
    doc: "If peptide sequences cannot be matched to any protein: 1) raise an error; 2) warn (unmatched PepHits will miss target/decoy annotation with downstream problems); 3) remove the hit."
    type: string?
  PeptideIndexing__aaa_max:

    type: long?
  PeptideIndexing__IL_equivalent:
    doc: Treat the isobaric amino acids isoleucine ('I') and leucine ('L') as equivalent (indistinguishable). Also occurrences of 'J' will be treated as 'I' thus avoiding ambiguous matching.
    type: boolean?

    doc: Allow the protein N-terminus amino acid to clip.
    type: string?
  PeptideIndexing__enzyme__name:
