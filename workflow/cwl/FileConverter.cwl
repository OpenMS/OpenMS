    doc: Output file
    type: string
  out_type:
    doc: "Output file type -- default: determined from file extension or content\nNote: that not all conversion paths work or make sense."
    type: string?
  TIC_DTA2D:
    doc: Export the TIC instead of the entire experiment in mzML/mzData/mzXML -> DTA2D conversions.
    type: boolean?
  MGF_compact:
    doc: Use a more compact format when writing MGF (no zero-intensity peaks, limited number of decimal places)
    type: boolean?
  force_MaxQuant_compatibility:
    doc: "[mzXML output only] Make sure that MaxQuant can read the mzXML and set the msManufacturer to 'Thermo Scientific'."
    type: boolean?
  force_TPP_compatibility:
    doc: "[mzML output only] Make sure that TPP parsers can read the mzML and the precursor ion m/z in the file (otherwise it will be set to zero by the TPP)."

  convert_to_chromatograms:
    doc: "[mzML output only] Assumes that the provided spectra represent data in SRM mode or targeted MS1 mode and converts them to chromatogram data."
    type: boolean?
  change_im_format:
    doc: "[mzML output only] How to store ion mobility scans (none: no change in format; multiple_spectra: store each IM frame as multiple scans (one per drift time value); concatenated: store whole frame as single scan with IM values in a FloatDataArray"
    type: string?
  write_scan_index:
    doc: Append an index when writing mzML or mzXML files. Some external tools might rely on it.
    type: string?
  lossy_compression:
    doc: "Use numpress compression to achieve optimally small file size using linear compression for m/z domain and slof for intensity and float data arrays (attention: may cause small loss of precision; only for mzML data)."

  lossy_mass_accuracy:
    doc: Desired (absolute) m/z accuracy for lossy compression (e.g. use 0.0001 for a mass accuracy of 0.2 ppm at 500 m/z, default uses -1.0 for maximal accuracy).
    type: double?
