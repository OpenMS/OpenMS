    doc: "Maximum absolute log10 fold change between two compatible signals during compatibility graph construction. Two signals from different maps will not be connected by an edge in the compatibility graph if absolute log fold change exceeds this limit (they might still end up in the same connected component, however). Note: this does not limit fold changes in the linking stage, only during RT alignment, where we try to find high-quality alignment anchor points. Setting this to a value < 0 disables the FC check."
