    doc: Use a gaussian filter width which has approximately the same width as your mass peaks (FWHM in m/z).

    doc: "Gaussian width, depending on the m/z position.\nThe higher the value, the wider the peak and therefore the wider the gaussian."
    type: double?
  algorithm__use_ppm_tolerance:
    doc: If true, instead of the gaussian_width value, the ppm_tolerance is used. The gaussian is calculated in each step anew, so this is much slower.
