  algorithm__rt_estimate:
    doc: If 'true' the optimal RT pair distance and deviation are estimated by fitting a gaussian distribution to the histogram of pair distance. Note that this works only datasets with a significant amount of pairs! If 'false' the parameters 'rt_pair_dist', 'rt_dev_low' and 'rt_dev_high' define the optimal distance.
