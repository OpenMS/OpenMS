    type: double?
  algorithm__min_peak_width:
    doc: Minimal peak width (s), discard all peaks below this value (-1 means no action).

    doc: Calculate the peak area and height either the smoothed or the raw chromatogram data.
    type: string?
  algorithm__background_subtraction:
    doc: "Remove background from peak signal using estimated noise levels. The 'original' method is only provided for historical purposes, please use the 'exact' method and set parameters using the PeakIntegrator: settings. The same original or smoothed chromatogram specified by peak_integration will be used for background estimation."
    type: string?
  algorithm__recalculate_peaks:
    doc: Tries to get better peak picking by looking at peak consistency of all picked peaks. Tries to use the consensus (median) peak border if the variation within the picked peaks is too large.
    type: boolean?
  algorithm__use_precursors:
    doc: Use precursor chromatogram for peak picking (note that this may lead to precursor signal driving the peak picking)
    type: boolean?

    doc: Use consensus peak boundaries when computing transition group picking (if false, compute independent peak boundaries for each transition)
    type: string?
  algorithm__recalculate_peaks_max_z:
    doc: Determines the maximal Z-Score (difference measured in standard deviations) that is considered too large for peak boundaries. If the Z-Score is above this value, the median is used for peak boundaries (default value 1.0).
    type: double?
  algorithm__minimal_quality:

    type: double?
  algorithm__compute_peak_quality:
    doc: Tries to compute a quality value for each peakgroup and detect outlier transitions. The resulting score is centered around zero and values above 0 are generally good and below -1 or -2 are usually bad.

  algorithm__PeakPickerChromatogram__peak_width:
    doc: Force a certain minimal peak_width on the data (e.g. extend the peak at least by this amount on both sides) in seconds. -1 turns this feature off.
    type: double?
  algorithm__PeakPickerChromatogram__signal_to_noise:
    doc: Signal-to-noise threshold at which a peak will not be extended any more. Note that setting this too high (e.g. 1.0) can lead to peaks whose flanks are not fully captured.
