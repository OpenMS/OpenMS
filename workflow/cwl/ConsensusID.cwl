  algorithm:
    doc: "Algorithm used for consensus scoring.\n* PEPMatrix: Scoring based on posterior error probabilities (PEPs) and peptide sequence similarities (scored by a substitution matrix). Requires PEPs as scores.\n* PEPIons: Scoring based on posterior error probabilities (PEPs) and fragment ion similarities ('shared peak count'). Requires PEPs as scores.\n* best: For each peptide ID, use the best score of any search engine as the consensus score. Requires the same score type in all ID runs.\n* worst: For each peptide ID, use the worst score of any search engine as the consensus score. Requires the same score type in all ID runs.\n* average:  For each peptide ID, use the average score of all search engines as the consensus. Requires the same score type in all ID runs.\n* ranks: Calculates a consensus score based on the ranks of peptide IDs in the results of different search engines. The final score is in the range (0, 1], with 1 being the best score. No requirements about score types."
