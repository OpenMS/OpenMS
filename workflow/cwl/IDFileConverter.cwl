This may be:\n- a single file in OpenMS database format (.oms),\n- a single file in a multi-purpose XML format (.idXML, .mzid, .pepXML, .protXML),\n- a single file in a search engine-specific format (Mascot: .mascotXML, OMSSA: .omssaXML, X! Tandem: .xml, Percolator: .psms, xQuest: .xquest.xml),\n- a single file in fasta format (can only be used to generate a theoretical mzML),\n- a single text file (tab separated) with one line for all peptide sequences matching a spectrum (top N hits),\n- for Sequest results, a directory containing .out files.\n"
