  retention_time_summarization_method:
    doc: How indistinguishable peptidoforms at different retention times should be treated. This is usually necessary for LFQ experiments and therefore defaults to 'max'. In case of TMT/iTRAQ, MSstatsTMT does the aggregation itself later and the parameter always resets to manual (i.e. is unused).
