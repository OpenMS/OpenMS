  decoy_generation:
    doc: Decoys will be generated using the fragmentation tree re-rooting approach. This option does only work in combination with the fragment annotation via Sirius.
    type: boolean?
  decoy_generation_method:
    doc: Uses different methods for decoy generation. Basis for the method is the fragmentation-tree re-rooting approach ('original'). This approach can be extended by using 'resolve_overlap', which will resolve overlapping fragments of the highest intensity fragments chosen, by adding -CH2 mass to the overlapping fragments. 'Add_shift' will add a -CH2 mass shift to the target fragments and use them as additional decoys if fragmentation-tree re-rooting failed. 'Both' combines the extended methods (resolve_overlap, add_shift).
