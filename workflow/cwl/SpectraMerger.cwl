    type: boolean?
  algorithm__mz_binning_width:
    doc: minimum m/z distance for two data points (profile data) or peaks (centroided data) to be considered distinct. Closer data points or peaks will be merged.
    type: double?

  algorithm__average_gaussian__spectrum_type:
    doc: Spectrum type of the MS level to be averaged
    type: string?
  algorithm__average_gaussian__ms_level:
    doc: If set to be 0, each MS level will be merged from 1 to max. Otherwise, average spectra of this level. All other spectra remain unchanged.
    type: long?
  algorithm__average_gaussian__rt_FWHM:
    doc: FWHM of Gauss curve in seconds to be averaged over.
    type: double?
  algorithm__average_gaussian__cutoff:
    doc: Intensity cutoff for Gaussian. The Gaussian RT profile decreases from 1 at its apex to 0 at infinity. Spectra for which the intensity of the Gaussian drops below the cutoff do not contribute to the average.

  algorithm__average_tophat__rt_range:
    doc: RT range to be averaged over, i.e. +/-(RT range)/2 from each spectrum.
    type: double?
  algorithm__average_tophat__rt_unit:
