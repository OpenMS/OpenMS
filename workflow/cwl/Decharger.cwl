  algorithm__FeatureDeconvolution__charge_span_max:
    doc: Maximal range of charges for a single analyte, i.e. observing q1=[5,6,7] implies span=3. Setting this to 1 will only find adduct variants of the same charge
    type: long?
  algorithm__FeatureDeconvolution__q_try:
    doc: Try different values of charge for each feature according to the above settings ('heuristic' [does not test all charges, just the likely ones] or 'all' ), or leave feature charge untouched ('feature').
    type: string?
  algorithm__FeatureDeconvolution__retention_max_diff:
    doc: Maximum allowed RT difference between any two features if their relation shall be determined
    type: double?
  algorithm__FeatureDeconvolution__retention_max_diff_local:
    doc: Maximum allowed RT difference between between two co-features, after adduct shifts have been accounted for (if you do not have any adduct shifts, this value should be equal to 'retention_max_diff', otherwise it should be smaller!)
    type: double?
  algorithm__FeatureDeconvolution__mass_max_diff:
    doc: Maximum allowed mass difference [in Th] for a single feature.
    type: double?
  algorithm__FeatureDeconvolution__potential_adducts:
    doc: "Adducts used to explain mass differences in format: 'Element:Charge(+/-):Probability[:RTShift[:Label]]', i.e. the number of '+' or '-' indicate the charge, e.g. 'Ca:++:0.5' indicates +2. Probabilites have to be in (0,1]. RTShift param is optional and indicates the expected RT shift caused by this adduct, e.g. '(2)H4H-4:0:1:-3' indicates a 4 deuterium label, which causes early elution by 3 seconds. As a fifth parameter you can add a label which is tagged on every feature which has this adduct. This also determines the map number in the consensus file."

  algorithm__FeatureDeconvolution__max_minority_bound:
    doc: Maximum count of the least probable adduct (according to 'potential_adducts' param) within a charge variant. E.g. setting this to 2 will not allow an adduct composition of '1(H+),3(Na+)' if Na+ is the least probable adduct
