  algorithm__gapcost:
    doc: This Parameter stands for the cost of opening a gap in the Alignment. A gap means that one spectrum can not be aligned directly to another spectrum in the Map. This happens, when the similarity of both spectra a too low or even not present. Imagine it as a insert or delete of the spectrum in the map (similar to sequence alignment). The gap is necessary for aligning, if we open a gap there is a possibility that an another spectrum can be correct aligned with a higher score as before without gap. But to open a gap is a negative event and needs to carry a punishment, so a gap should only be opened if the benefits outweigh the downsides. The Parameter is to giving as a positive number, the implementation convert it to a negative number.

  algorithm__affinegapcost:
    doc: This Parameter controls the cost of extension a already open gap. The idea behind the affine gapcost lies under the assumption, that it is better to get a long distance of connected gaps than to have a structure of gaps interspersed with matches (gap match gap match etc.). Therefore the punishment for the extension of a gap generally should be lower than the normal gapcost. If the result of the alignment shows high compression, it is a good idea to lower either the affine gapcost or gap opening cost.

  algorithm__cutoff_score:
    doc: The Parameter defines the threshold which filtered spectra, these spectra are high potential candidate for deciding the interval of a sub-alignment.  Only those pair of spectra are selected, which has a score higher or same of the threshold.
    type: double?
  algorithm__bucketsize:
    doc: Defines the numbers of buckets. It is a quantize of the interval of those points, which defines the main alignment (match points). These points have to filtered, to reduce the amount of points for the calculating a smoother spline curve.
    type: long?
  algorithm__anchorpoints:
    doc: Defines the percent of numbers of match points which a selected from one bucket. The high score pairs are previously selected. The reduction of match points helps to get a smoother spline curve.

    type: boolean?
  algorithm__mismatchscore:
    doc: "Defines the score of two spectra if they have no similarity to each other. "
    type: double?
  algorithm__scorefunction:
    doc: The score function is the core of an alignment. The success of an alignment depends mostly of the elected score function. The score function return the similarity of two spectra. The score influence defines later the way of possible traceback. There are multiple spectra similarity scores available..

  model__b_spline__wavelength:
    doc: Determines the amount of smoothing by setting the number of nodes for the B-spline. The number is chosen so that the spline approximates a low-pass filter with this cutoff wavelength. The wavelength is given in the same units as the data; a higher value means more smoothing. '0' sets the number of nodes to twice the number of input points.
