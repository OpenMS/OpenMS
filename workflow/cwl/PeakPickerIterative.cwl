  algorithm__signal_to_noise_:
    doc: Signal to noise value, each peak is required to be above this value (turn off by setting it to 0.0)
    type: double?
  algorithm__peak_width:
    doc: Expected peak width half width in Dalton - peaks will be extended until this half width is reached (even if the intensitity is increasing). In conjunction with check_width_internally it will also be used to remove peaks whose spacing is larger than this value.
    type: double?
  algorithm__spacing_difference:
    doc: Difference between peaks in multiples of the minimal difference to continue. The higher this value is set, the further apart peaks are allowed to be to still extend a peak. E.g. if the value is set to 1.5 and in a current peak the minimal spacing between peaks is 10 mDa, then only peaks at most 15 mDa apart will be added to the peak.

  algorithm__nr_iterations_:
    doc: Nr of iterations to perform (how many times the peaks are re-centered).
