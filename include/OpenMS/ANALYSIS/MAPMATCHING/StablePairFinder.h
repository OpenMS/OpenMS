  /**
   @brief This class implements a pair finding algorithm for consensus features.

   It offers a method to determine pairs across two consensus maps. The corresponding consensus features must be aligned, but may have small position deviations.

	 The distance measure is implemented in class @ref FeatureDistance - see there for details.

	 <B> Additional criteria for pairing </B>

	 Depending on parameter @p use_identifications, peptide identifications annotated to the features may have to be compatible (i.e. no annotation or the same annotation) for a pairing to occur.

   Stability criterion: The distance to the nearest neighbor must be smaller than the distance to the second-nearest neighbor by a certain factor, see parameter @p second_nearest_gap. There is a non-trivial relation between this parameter and the maximum allowed difference (in RT or m/z) of the distance measure: If @p second_nearest_gap is greater than one, lowering @p max_difference may in fact lead to more - rather than fewer - pairings, because it increases the distance difference between the nearest and the second-nearest neighbor, so that the constraint imposed by @p second_nearest_gap may be fulfilled more often.

	 <B> Quality calculation </B>

	 The quality of a pairing is computed from the distance between the paired elements (nearest neighbors) and the distances to the second-nearest neighbors of both elements, according to the formula:

	 @f[
	 q_{i,j} = \big( 1 - d_{i,j} \big) \cdot 
	 \big( 1 - \frac{g \cdot d_{i,j}}{d_{2,i}} \big) \cdot
	 \big( 1 - \frac{g \cdot d_{i,j}}{d_{2,j}} \big) \cdot
	 @f]

	 @f$ q_{i,j} @f$ is the quality of the pairing of elements @em i and @em j, @f$ d_{i,j} @f$ is the distance between the two, @f$ d_{2,i} @f$ and @f$d_{2,j} @f$ are the distances to the second-nearest neighbors of @em i and @em j, respectively, and @em g is the factor defined by parameter @p second_nearest_gap.

	 Note that by the definition of the distance measure, @f$ 0 \leq d_{i,j} \leq 1 @f$ if @em i and @em j are to form a pair. The criteria for pairing further require that @f$ g \cdot d_{i,j} \leq d_{2,i} @f$ and @f$ g \cdot d_{i,j} \leq d_{2,j} @f$. This ensures that the resulting quality is always between one (best) and zero (worst).

	 For the final quality @em q of the consensus feature produced by merging two paired elements (@em i and @em j), the existing quality values of the two elements are taken into account. The final quality is a weighted average of the existing qualities (@f$ q_i @f$ and @f$ q_j @f$) and the quality of the pairing (@f$ q_{i,j} @f$, see above):

	 @f[
	 q = \frac{q_{i,j} + (s_i - 1) \cdot q_i + (s_j - 1) \cdot q_j}{s_i + s_j - 1}
	 @f]

	 The weighting factors @f$ s_i @f$ and @f$ s_j @f$ are the sizes (i.e. numbers of subelements) of the two consensus features @em i and @em j. That way, it is possible to link several feature maps to a growing consensus map in a stepwise fashion (as done by @ref FeatureGroupingAlgorithmUnlabeled), and in the end obtain quality values that incorporate the qualities of all pairings that occurred during the generation of a consensus feature. Note that "missing" elements (if a consensus feature does not contain sub-features from all input maps) are not punished in this definition of quality.
