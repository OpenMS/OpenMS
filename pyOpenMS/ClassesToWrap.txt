The TOPP tools are divided into several subgroups:

# In general, file handling is wrapped by FORMAT/ file handlers. Currently wrapped are the following formats:
- ConsensusXML
- FeatureXML
- IdXML
- ParamXML
- PepXML
- TransformationXML
- TraML
- MzData
- MzML
- MzQuantML
- MzXML

x  FileInfo - Shows basic information about the file, such as data ranges and file type. # all in tool
x  FileMerger - Merges several MS files into one file. # all in tool
x  IDMerger - Merges several protein/peptide identification files into one file. # all in tool
x  IDFileConverter - Converts identification engine file formats. # all in tool
