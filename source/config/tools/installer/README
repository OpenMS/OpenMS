This directory contains all files necessary to create a windows installer from an MinGW/MSYS installation of OpenMS (System A)

additional required software:
- NSIS (NullSoft Installer System)
 

Quick guide:
- fully compile and test OpenMS
- compile OpenMS_installer.nsi using NSIS (this should create a file named OpenMS_setup.exe)
- distribute


Verify the installer:
- use a VM (System B)
- do NOT assume that sucessfully installing OpenMS_setup.exe on the system A means that the installer will work
  on a new system (B)! But you can at least check for major quirks.
- check if all files were created and start-menu entries are present and working
- to test the TOPP tools, run TOPPTest_Assembler.pl on System A within an MSYS console
  e.g.
  > perl TOPPTest_Assembler.pl  /d/uni/OpenMS_Win/my/OpenMS
  	
	Now, copy the folder /OpenMS/source/TEST/TOPP/ to System B and run TOPP_test.bat (which should have been created by the perl script).
	Check for anything containing 
	
	TOPP Command in line <xy> failed!
	
	, where <xy> will give the actual line number.
