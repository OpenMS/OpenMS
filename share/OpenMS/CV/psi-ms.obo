At each point in the data set a low-degree polynomial is fit to a subset of the data, with explanatory variable values near the point whose response is being estimated. The polynomial is fit using weighted least squares, giving more weight to points near the point whose response is being estimated and less weight to points further away. The value of the regression function for the point is then obtained by evaluating the local polynomial using the explanatory variable values for that data point. The LOESS fit is complete after regression function values have been computed for each of the n data points.

The metric's value triplet represents the log ratio of the TIC-change Q2 to Q1, Q3 to Q2, TIC-change-max to Q3" [PSI:MS]
comment: The metric informs about the dynamic range of the acquisition along the chromatographic separation.This metric evaluates the stability (similarity) of MS1 TIC values from scan to scan along the LC run. High log ratios representing very large intensity differences between pairs of scans might be due to electrospray instability or presence of a chemical contaminant.
