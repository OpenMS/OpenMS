This is the text file based OpenMS DocumentID pool.

*** General Information ***

By default the file IDPool.txt in this directory is used as ID pool by the TOPP tools capable of
assigning DocumentID's.
The file format is very simple: one line equals one unique ID.
e.g.
>>> IDPool.txt:
ABC123
ABC124
ABC125
<<< END IDPool.txt

However the default ID pool file is *empty*.

OpenMS will issue a warning once the ID pool file reaches a critical low level of five(5) remaining IDs.


*** Using other ID Pool files ***

If you wish to use another file as IDPool set the
environment variable OPENMS_IDPOOL_FILE to the appropriate file path before calling the TOPP tool.


*** Anticipated problems ***

On Linux, some older kernels do not support file locking on remote network drives. If you happen to have OpenMS installed
on a network drive and experience problems, try using a local file as ID pool (just set OPENMS_IDPOOL_FILE environment variable).
