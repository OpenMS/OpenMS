 <summary>OpenMS' viewer for mass spectrometry (MS) data from Proteomics and Metabolomics</summary>
 <description>
  <p>
   TOPPView is a viewer for MS and HPLC-MS data supporting many common formats, e.g. mzML, mzData, mzXML and several others.
   The viewer supports 1D, 2D, 3D views, zooming, distance measurements and data annotations.
   It also allows to run many OpenMS TOPP tools and immediately inspect the data.
  </p>
  <p>
   OpenMS is a powerful set of tools as well as a C++ library to
   process low and high-resolution LC-MS(-MS) mass spectrometry data.
  </p>
  <p>
   OpenMS is modular, consisting of more than 80 chainable tools (executables).
   It features a graphical data viewer (TOPPView), a pipeline editor (TOPPAS) and
   wrappers for most tandem-MS search engines (like Mascot, MSGF+ and X!Tandem).
   The OpenMS library itself comes with Python bindings for rapid prototyping.
