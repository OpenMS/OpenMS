 <summary>Pipeline editor of OpenMS (a mass spectrometry (MS) software for Proteomics and Metabolomics)</summary>
 <description>
  <p>
   TOPPAS is the OpenMS TOPP Pipeline Assistant. It can create processing pipelines
   using OpenMS TOPP tools as building blocks.
  </p>
  <p>
   OpenMS is a powerful set of tools as well as a C++ library to
   process low and high-resolution LC-MS(-MS) mass spectrometry data.
  </p>
  <p>
   OpenMS is modular, consisting of more than 80 chainable TOPP tools (executables).
   It features a graphical data viewer (TOPPView), a pipeline editor (TOPPAS) and
   wrappers for most tandem-MS search engines (like Mascot, MSGF+ and X!Tandem).
   The OpenMS library itself comes with Python bindings for rapid prototyping.
