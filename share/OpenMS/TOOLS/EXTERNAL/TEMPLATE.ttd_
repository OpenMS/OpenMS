			// output mapping/copying: this is a little hard to explain and usually you will not need it (then you have to delete all file-tags!)
			// what it does: when the wrapped tool works with in-place files (i.e. overwrites its input), you must copy it before
			//               ,e.g. TPP's RefreshParser will overwrite its input pepXML file
			//               The targeted parameter gets replaced with the temporary filename after the copy is done, so that subsequent
			//               operations target the temp file

			// output mapping/moving: this is a little hard to explain and usually you will not need it (then you have to delete all file-tags!)
			// what it does: when you cannot specify an explicit output file to the external tool and it rather determines that by itself
			//               ,e.g. msconvert will create an output file (call it F_E) which has the same name as the input file with a replaced suffix
			//               then you might need to move F_E to the name you want (and/or where TOPPAS can find it)
			//               Thus you specify the name of F_E and the target name (in terms of INI parameter values)
