 OpenMS is a package for LC/MS data management and analysis. OpenMS
 offers an infrastructure for the development of mass
 spectrometry-related software and powerful 2D and 3D visualization
 solutions.
 .
 TOPP (the OpenMS PiPeline) is a pipeline for the analysis
 of HPLC/MS data. It consists of a set of numerous small applications
 that can be chained together to create analysis pipelines tailored
 for a specific problem."
