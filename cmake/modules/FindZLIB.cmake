# - Find zlib

# based on the FindZLIB.cmake distributed with CMake 2.8.10.2
# modified to search for debug and optimized versions of zlib

# Find the native ZLIB includes and library.
# Once done this will define
#
#  ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIRS   - where to find zlib.h, etc.
#  ZLIB_LIBRARIES      - List of libraries when using zlib.
#  ZLIB_FOUND          - True if zlib found.
#
#  ZLIB_VERSION_STRING - The version of zlib found (x.y.z)
#  ZLIB_VERSION_MAJOR  - The major version of zlib
#  ZLIB_VERSION_MINOR  - The minor version of zlib
#  ZLIB_VERSION_PATCH  - The patch version of zlib
#  ZLIB_VERSION_TWEAK  - The tweak version of zlib
#
# The following variable are provided for backward compatibility
#
#  ZLIB_MAJOR_VERSION  - The major version of zlib
#  ZLIB_MINOR_VERSION  - The minor version of zlib
#  ZLIB_PATCH_VERSION  - The patch version of zlib
#
# An includer may set ZLIB_ROOT to a zlib installation root to tell
# this module where to look.
