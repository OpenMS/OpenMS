### INSTALLING TOPP into your local shell ###

To use TOPP tools as regular applications in your shell just add the following lines to your ~/.profile file. 
(Adapt the first line to point to the folder where you put OpenMS, e.g.: /Applications/OpenMS-1.11.0)

export OPENMS_TOPP_PATH=<OpenMS-PATH>
source $OPENMS_TOPP_PATH/.TOPP_bash_profile
