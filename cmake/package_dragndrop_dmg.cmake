## drag'n'drop installaltion configuration
## Note: We have certain dependencies between the individual components!!!
##       To ensure that the components are executed in the correct order
##       we use the fact that cmake executes them in alphabetical order
##        1. A-Z
##        2. a-z
##       So before adding an additional target make sure that you do not
##       intefer with other namings/components.
##
## Note: That the mac app bundles (TOPPView) take care of them selfes
##       when installed as dmg
