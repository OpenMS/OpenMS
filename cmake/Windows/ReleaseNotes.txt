Congratulations!  You have successfully installed the TOPP tools of OpenMS and
the OpenMS library.

"TOPP" is an acronym for "The OpenMS PiPeline".  It consists of
several small applications that can be chained to create analysis pipelines
tailored for a specific problem.

Note that this Windows binary release is meant for end-users only, rather than
for developers who want to contribute algorithms. Developers should download
the source code version (see https://www.openms.de for details).

======================
Read the documentation
======================

To get familiar with TOPP we recommend reading the documentation. 
If you installed the documention that came with this installer,
look into your Windows Start-Menu and start typing "OpenMS Documentation".
Autocompletion will do the rest...

You can also visit our online documentation at https://openms.de/current_doxygen/, which is identical to the
local docs (if you installed them).

Another good source of information with an introduction to the wider OpenMS ecosystem can be found at
https://openms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/introduction.html
