This folder includes small scripts, executables and a plugin for NSIS.
The plugin was tested with the current NSIS version 3.01. If they stop working at some point, please upgrade them. License can be found in the Doc folders.
The plugin in the Contrib, Docs, Examples, Plugins folder is the INetc plugin for downloading stuff.

Do not forget to globally install the UltraModernUI 2.0 plugin (tested with 2016-12-25; not shipped because of its size) and the large String build of NSIS.
