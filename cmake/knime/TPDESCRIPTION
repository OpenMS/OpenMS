OpenMS is an open-source software C++ library for LC/MS data management and 
analyses. It offers an infrastructure for the development of mass 
spectrometry related software and powerful 2D and 3D visualization.

The OpenMS Thirdparty adapters are free software available under the three clause BSD license and run
under Windows, macOS and Linux. They wrap common tools for mass spectrometry data analysis
from other vendors/groups in the OpenMS and GKN framework from which KNIME nodes can easily be generated.

For licenses, disclaimers etc. regarding the underlying tools, please read
