########################################################### Fixing dynamic dependencies
## Qt Plugins needed for the CL tools should have been installed before (such as QSqliteDriverPlugin)
## This currently works because our libs and TOPP tools include all dependencies. For macOS,
##  the app bundles need to have a different RUNTIME_DEPENDENCY_SET (TOPPView_DEPS, ...) due
##  to CMake assuming you want standalone bundles. But we want to share libs between them.

# This would be to look in the Contrib and other cmake_prefix_paths for dependencies.
#list(TRANSFORM CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH APPEND "/bin" OUTPUT_VARIABLE DEP_BIN_DIRS)
#list(TRANSFORM CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH APPEND "/lib" OUTPUT_VARIABLE DEP_LIB_DIRS)
# But since we copy them in the build stage to our runtime directory (bin), we can add this one.

# On Windows we need to tell CMake where to look for.
# We also do not need API sets. So exclude them.
