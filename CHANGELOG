----                                OpenMS 1.11.1                                     ----
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release date: November 2013

OpenMS 1.11.1 is a bugfix release resolving the following issues with OpenMS 1.11:

TOPPAS:
- fixed bug that caused TOPPAS to crash when a connection between nodes was added under certain circumstances

TOPP:
- XMLValidator can now be used on mzML files
- fixed bug in MSSimulator/EnzymaticDigestion where amino acid "U" was leading to crash
- fixed some problems with protein modifications in MascotAdapterOnline
- fixed potential problems of TOPP help screens on small screens / small terminal windows

Build system:
- fixed issues with CMake 2.8.12
- fixed potential clang compile errors

General:
- fixed issues with MIME types in KNIME

Resolved issues:
  #606 TOPPAS crashes during creation of certain edges.
  #609 MascotAdapterOnline: Problems with modifications
  #614 Amino acid "U" leads to crash in MSSimulator/EnzymaticDigestion
  #629 OpenMS is incompatible with CMake 2.8.12
  #630 Knime mime.types file should have lower case mime type names
  #633 ConsoleUtils::breakString triggers uncaught exception if terminal size is too small

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----                                  OpenMS 1.11                                     ----
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release date: August 2013

OpenMS 1.11 is the first release with fully integrated Python bindings (termed pyOpenMS).
For further details, please refer to https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyopenms

File formats:
- QcML support
- pepXML exported from Mascot (added support)
- mzTab updated to 1.0RC3
- ParamXML updated to v 1.6.2
- support for CTD schema 0.3
- full support of sourceFile tag in mzML (all source files are written, SHA1 support)

TOPPView:
- handle .mzML file with mixed spectra and chromatograms (prefer spectra)
- chromatograms of all types can be displayed (not just SRM)
- link to documentation and webpage fixed
- fix a segfault when loading empty chromatograms into TOPPView

TOPPAS:
- link to documentation and webpage fixed

TOPP tools:
- MODIFIED:
  - FeatureLinkerUnlabeledQT: performance (speed and memory) improvement
  - FeatureLinkerUnlabeled: performance (memory) improvement (now constant in number of input maps)
  - MapAlignerPoseClustering: performance (memory) improvement (now constant in number of input maps)
  - EICExtractor: critical bugfix if the input map was not sorted
  - PeptideIndexer: by default now demands that the peptide is fully tryptic ("-enzyme:specificity none" restores the old behavior)
  - FileFilter: filter MS2 spectra by consensus map feature overlap, collision energy, isolation window width
  - ProteinResolver: documentation and interface improvements
  - QCCalculator/QCEmbedder/QCExtractor: multiple improvements
  - WindowMower: speed improvement (movetype either slide or jump [faster])
- ADDED
  - AccurateMassSearch: AccurateMassSearch assembles metabolite features from singleton mass traces.
  - IsobaricAnalyzer: Extracts and normalizes isobaric labeling information from an MS experiment. This merges the previous TMTAnalyzer and ITRAQAnalyzer functionality
  - QCExtractor: Extracts a table attachment to a given qc parameter
  - QCImporter: Embed tables or pictures in QcML

General:
- Python bindings allow full access to the OpenMS API from Python
- TOPPTools now support passing of all parameters on the command line (use --helphelp)
- Better chromatogram support (for NoiseFilterGaussian, NoiseFilterSGolay, PeakPickerHiRes)

Search engine support:
- Mascot 2.4 is now supported
- OMSSAAdapter with improved memory footprint
- N-terminal modifications work now with X!Tandem

Changes to the Build System / Package System:
- shared linking works for all contrib packages with automated detection using CMake find modules
- upgrade of xerces to version 3.1.1
- upgrade of libsvm to version 3.12

Development:
- public inheritance from std::vector and std::set has been reduced in the
  OpenMS codebase (removed from ConsensusFeature, FeatureMap, ConsensusMap,
  MSExperiment)
- addition of the OpenMS/INTERFACES folder which contains proposed OpenMS
  interfaces for reading/writing spectra

Deprecated:
- TMTAnalyzer, ITRAQAnalyzer -> please use IsobaricAnalyzer instead
- Several functions provided by std::vector in the MSSpectrum interface are now
  deprecated (e.g. push_back, reserve etc.)

Resolved issues:
  #120	Improve visual representation of edges
  #151	Optimize time/memory efficiency of critical tools/algorithms
  #184	Some OpenMS classes are derived from std::vector
  #309	FileConverter puts incorrect/incomplete information in <sourceFile>
  #343	OpenMS build system should allow searching for contrib libs also in system paths (e.g., /opt/local/..)
  #382	Excessive memory usage by MapAligners and FeatureLinkers

----                                  OpenMS 1.9                                      ----
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release date: February 2012

OpenMS 1.9 has some major changes in TOPP tool names and usage. Therefore all .ini files
for "typed" TOPP tools (i.e. those with a "type" parameter) built with OpenMS 1.8 and below
are incompatible! To fix your old .ini and .toppas files use the new
INIUpdater tool (see its documentation and the TOPP documentation in general).

OpenMS 1.9 removed support for Mac OS X 10.5.

Documentation:
- new Quickstart tutorial
- dedicated and reworked TOPPAS tutorial

TOPPView improvements:
-MODIFIED:
  - ConsensusFeatures can now be colored using MetaValues
  - better grid line drawing/calculation, extracted AxisPainter class
  - IdentificationView:
    - added automatic labeling with peptide fragment sequence
    - theoretical spectrum is now hidden by default (labeling contains relevant information for most use cases)
    - automatic zoom to measured MS2 data range

TOPPAS improvements:
	- TOPPAS allows for interactive download of preconfigured TOPPAS pipelines from OpenMS homepage
	- "Recycling" mode for nodes, useful for database input files (see docu for details)
- more flexible pipeline design for Merger nodes
- Merger nodes (merge, merge all) renamed to "Merge" (one round) and "Collect" (all rounds)


TOPP tools:
- ADDED:
  - MapStatistics: statistics for low level quality control
  - EICExtractor: quantify known RT, m/z locations in one or many LC/MS maps and align them
  - MassTraceExtractor: annotate mass traces in centroided LC/MS maps - useful for metabolomics and top-down proteomics (use FeatureFinder tools for peptides)
  - FeatureFinderRaw: feature finding on raw data
	- FeatureFinderMetabo: feature finding for metabolites
  - IDConflictResolver: resolve ambiguous annotations of features with peptide identifications
- MODIFIED:
  - FeatureFinder: split into FeatureFinderMRM, FeatureFinderCentroided, FeatureFinderIsotopeWavelet
  - FeatureLinker: split into FeatureLinkerLabeled, FeatureLinkerUnlabeled, FeatureLinkerUnlabeledQT
  - FeatureLinker tools remove unneeded data after loading featureXML files to conserve memory
  - MapAligner: split into MapAlignerIdentification, MapAlignerPoseClustering, MapAlignerSpectrum, and MapRTTransformer
  - model parameters of MapAligner tools are now set in the INI file
  - MapAlignerIdentification: don't fail if parameter "min_run_occur" is set too high, warn and use possible maximum instead
  - NoiseFilter: split into NoiseFilterGaussian and NoiseFilterSGolay
  - PeakPicker: split into PeakPickerWavelet and PeakPickerHiRes
  - PILISModel: split into PILISModelCV, PILISModelTrainer, and PILISSpectraGenerator
  - MascotAdapterOnline: now supports Mascot 2.3 servers
  - ProteinQuantifier: added support for writing idXML (suitable for export to mzTab)
  - IDFileConverter: when reading pepXML, fail if the requested experiment (parameters "mz_file"/"mz_name") could not be found in the file
- REMOVED:
  - AndiMS/NetCDF is no longer supported on any platform
  - removed IDDecoyProbability tool

UTIL tools:
- ADDED:
  - INIUpdater: update INI and TOPPAS files
  - TransformationEvaluation: evaluate a (RT) transformation by applying it to a range of values
- REMOVED:
  - CaapConvert
  - UniqueIdAssigner
  - HistView

Changes to the Build System:
	- TOPPAS now requires Qt's Webkit library
	- Use CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE instead of OPENMS_BUILD_TYPE (removed)
	- Use CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH instead of CONTRIB_CUSTOM_DIR (deprecated)
  - Removed AndiMS, NetCDF and dependencies
	- Removed dependency to imslib, relevant classes were moved directly to OpenMS/CHEMISTRY/MASSDECOMPOSITION/IMS
- OpenMS now supports ctests functionality for optimized and parallel testing (see ticket #363)

Fixed Issues: (see also http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/open-ms/report)
