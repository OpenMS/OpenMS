----                                OpenMS 3.2     (in development)                   ----
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's new:
- Breaking change: Rename of parameters for FeatureFinderCentroided (debug->advanced), and PeakPickerWavelet/TOFCalibration (optimization -> optimization:type) (#7154)

Library:
- Extend FileHandler to support load and store operations for our major datastructures (spectra, features, identifications, etc.). Replaced file type specific code with the more generic FileHandler calls to decouple the IO code from other parts of the library.
- SiriusAdapter reworked to SiriusExport: Instead of running SIRIUS directly, this reworked tool takes multiple mzML and feautureXML (optional) files exporting a single SIRIUS .ms input file as well as an input table with compound info from features for the new AssayGeneratorMetaboSirius tool. (#7234)
- Splitting AssayGeneratorMetabo into two tools: In line with the changes to SiriusExport this tool has been split into two separate workflows. AssayGeneratorMetabo generates an assay library from mzML and feautreXML files using an heuristic approach picking the highest intensity MS2 peaks (like before). AssayGeneratorMetaboSirius takes an existing SIRIUS project directory as input to generate an assay library based on fragmentation trees. (#7234)
- better documentation for all SpectraFilter... tools (#7183)
- TOPPView: offer Ion mobility view from 2D spectra view (#7423)
- TOPPView: view ion mobility frames, irrespective of its MS level (formerly only MS1 was supported) (#7427)


Fixes:
- TOPPView: fix crash when viewing certain Chromatograms (#7220)
- TOPPView: in 2D view, show correct adjacent layers in context menu, if user clicked to the right of the last MS1 scan (now shows the 4 rightmost MS1 scans, used to show the 4 leftmost scans) (#7423)
- more robust parsing of mzIdentML (#7153)
- more robust FileConverter (#7176)
- MSFragger: allow relative path to database (#7155)
- MSGFPlusAdapter: allow concurrent creation of indexed database (#7272)
- ParamEditor: fixed error for the subsection parameter (ParamNode) to go through store function (#7180)
- TOPPAS: open files in TOPPView (#7213)
- pyOpenMS: Log warnings in pure Python code with warnings.warn instead of print (#7418)

Misc:
- OpenMSInfo reports the ILP solver (CoinOr or glpk) (#7156)
- add citation information for OpenMS 3.0 (Nat. Methods) (#7383)
- Add export for Common Workflow Language (CWL) (#6156)
- Add tool description lib (TDL) dependency (#6156)

Note: The goal of our library is to provide useful, reusable code in a way that’s easy to understand and use.
To make OpenMS simpler, more focused and more accessible we gradually remove potentially outdated tools and algorithms.
If you, as a user, are negatively affected by this step please contact us. We listen to our users and will try to find 
an alternative solution or reverse a particular decision for removal.

Release date: February 2015

OpenMS 2.0 is the first release after the switch to git and a complete overhaul of the
build system. It introduces a considerable number of new features and bug fixes.

Furthermore, we removed the dependency to GSL and replaced the functionality using

----                                  OpenMS 1.9                                      ----
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release date: February 2012

OpenMS 1.9 has some major changes in TOPP tool names and usage. Therefore all .ini files
for "typed" TOPP tools (i.e. those with a "type" parameter) built with OpenMS 1.8 and below
are incompatible! To fix your old .ini and .toppas files use the new
INIUpdater tool (see its documentation and the TOPP documentation in general).

OpenMS 1.9 removed support for Mac OS X 10.5.

Documentation:
- new Quickstart tutorial
- dedicated and reworked TOPPAS tutorial

TOPPView improvements:
-MODIFIED:
  - ConsensusFeatures can now be colored using MetaValues
  - better grid line drawing/calculation, extracted AxisPainter class
  - IdentificationView:
    - added automatic labeling with peptide fragment sequence
    - theoretical spectrum is now hidden by default (labeling contains relevant information for most use cases)
    - automatic zoom to measured MS2 data range

TOPPAS improvements:
	- TOPPAS allows for interactive download of preconfigured TOPPAS pipelines from OpenMS homepage
	- "Recycling" mode for nodes, useful for database input files (see docu for details)
- more flexible pipeline design for Merger nodes
- Merger nodes (merge, merge all) renamed to "Merge" (one round) and "Collect" (all rounds)


TOPP tools:
- ADDED:
  - MapStatistics: statistics for low level quality control
  - EICExtractor: quantify known RT, m/z locations in one or many LC/MS maps and align them
  - MassTraceExtractor: annotate mass traces in centroided LC/MS maps - useful for metabolomics and top-down proteomics (use FeatureFinder tools for peptides)
  - FeatureFinderRaw: feature finding on raw data
	- FeatureFinderMetabo: feature finding for metabolites
  - IDConflictResolver: resolve ambiguous annotations of features with peptide identifications
- MODIFIED:
  - FeatureFinder: split into FeatureFinderMRM, FeatureFinderCentroided, FeatureFinderIsotopeWavelet
  - FeatureLinker: split into FeatureLinkerLabeled, FeatureLinkerUnlabeled, FeatureLinkerUnlabeledQT
  - FeatureLinker tools remove unneeded data after loading featureXML files to conserve memory
  - MapAligner: split into MapAlignerIdentification, MapAlignerPoseClustering, MapAlignerSpectrum, and MapRTTransformer
  - model parameters of MapAligner tools are now set in the INI file
  - MapAlignerIdentification: don't fail if parameter "min_run_occur" is set too high, warn and use possible maximum instead
  - NoiseFilter: split into NoiseFilterGaussian and NoiseFilterSGolay
  - PeakPicker: split into PeakPickerWavelet and PeakPickerHiRes
  - PILISModel: split into PILISModelCV, PILISModelTrainer, and PILISSpectraGenerator
  - MascotAdapterOnline: now supports Mascot 2.3 servers
  - ProteinQuantifier: added support for writing idXML (suitable for export to mzTab)
  - IDFileConverter: when reading pepXML, fail if the requested experiment (parameters "mz_file"/"mz_name") could not be found in the file
- REMOVED:
  - AndiMS/NetCDF is no longer supported on any platform
  - removed IDDecoyProbability tool

UTIL tools:
- ADDED:
  - INIUpdater: update INI and TOPPAS files
  - TransformationEvaluation: evaluate a (RT) transformation by applying it to a range of values
- REMOVED:
  - CaapConvert
  - UniqueIdAssigner
  - HistView

Changes to the Build System:
	- TOPPAS now requires Qt's Webkit library
	- Use CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE instead of OPENMS_BUILD_TYPE (removed)
	- Use CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH instead of CONTRIB_CUSTOM_DIR (deprecated)
  - Removed AndiMS, NetCDF and dependencies
	- Removed dependency to imslib, relevant classes were moved directly to OpenMS/CHEMISTRY/MASSDECOMPOSITION/IMS
- OpenMS now supports ctests functionality for optimized and parallel testing (see ticket #363)

Fixed Issues: (see also http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/open-ms/report)
